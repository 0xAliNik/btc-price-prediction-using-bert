Read more about Bitcoin’s potential 2022 rise and Bitcoin 2022 predictions.,https://www.deseret.com/2022/1/12/22879937/bitcoin-drop-rise-record-high-value,"Bitcoin could see such a big rise that it breaks previous records.
What happened: Bitcoin, one of the most valuable and popular cryptocurrencies, has seen a major drop-off in recent weeks, falling to below $40,000, per Fortune. This is after the crypto coin spent multiple months around $60,000 value per coin.
Yes, but: Bitcoin could soon double in value to reach $75,000 per coin as more people embrace it, Guido Buehler, the CEO of Swiss bank Seba, told CNBC.
“We believe the price is going up,” he told CNBC.
“Our internal valuation models indicate a price right now between $50,000 and $75,000.”
“I’m quite confident we are going to see that level. The question is always timing.”
Why it matters: Cryptocurrency has been considered a volatile investment because the value spikes and dips rapidly. Bitcoin is clearly not immune from this.
The bigger picture: Bitcoin wasn’t the only cryptocurrency to drop. Others such as Ethereum and Solana fell off as well, as I reported for the Deseret news."

A recent letter published to the Bitcoin developers mailing list written by Square founder Jack Dorsey indicates that a legal defense fund has been created for open source developers in order to protect them “from lawsuits regarding their activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem.” Dorsey’s letter is also signed by Alex Morcos of Chaincode Labs and Martin White, the co-founder of Hudson River Trading.
Jack Dorsey’s Open Letter to the Bitcoin Developers Mailing List Reveals Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund
According to an open letter from Jack Dorsey, Alex Morcos, and Martin White, “the Bitcoin community is currently the subject of multi-front litigation.” While the letter does not specifically detail any of the legal cases developers are dealing with, it mentions that “individual defendants have chosen to capitulate in the absence of legal support.”
However, the letter does hint at the Tulip Trading lawsuit, which involves Craig Wright, the Australian who claims he is Satoshi Nakamoto and the inventor of Bitcoin. “The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is a nonprofit entity that aims to minimize legal headaches that discourage software developers from actively developing Bitcoin and related projects such as the Lightning Network, Bitcoin privacy protocols, and the like,” the letter from Dorsey, White, and Morcos states. The open letter continues:
The fund’s first activities will be to take over coordination of the existing defense of the Tulip Trading lawsuit against certain developers alleging breach of fiduciary duty and provide the source of funding for outside counsel. At this time, the fund is not seeking to raise additional money for its operations but will do so at the direction of the board if needed for further legal action or to pay for staff.
Bitcoin Community Appreciates Legal Defense Fund Effort
The letter explains that interested people with questions or concerns can email the fund’s team and the email domain “bitcoindefensefund.org” is mentioned. The website seems to be under construction at the moment, as a message from the domain host Namebright notes the site is “coming soon.” Of course, the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund became a trending topic on social media after the open letter was published.
Open source developer Bryan Bishop tweeted that he was “very grateful to see Jack’s support on the Bitcoin Developer Legal Defense Fund.” Bitcoiner Marty Bent wrote: “Shoutout to Jack, Alex Morcos, and Martin White for stepping up to protect Bitcoin developers from getting bogged down by lawsuits so they can focus on what they do best. Really cool to see come through the bitcoin-dev mailing list this evening,” Bent added.

The lucky miner, who may have been mining on just one or two machines, solved a block with their modest hash rate capacity of 126 terahashes per second (TH/s). According to a Tuesday tweet from Solo admin Con Kolivas, it’s equivalent to about 0.000072% of the total Bitcoin network hash rate, which is 175,000,000 TH/s.
Bitcoin mining expert and member of the Bitcoin Mining Council Hass McCook told Cointelegraph that he has never heard of anything like it, adding, “To say this is very rare is an understatement.”
“Usually, having 0.000072% of the hash rate means that, on average, Solo CK will win 0.000072% of the blocks, or about 1 in 1,400,000,” he explained.
“Everything in Bitcoin is probabilistic, even transaction settlement. The more confirmations you have on your tx, the less likely it will be reversed.”

According to McCook, the miner could’ve been using a single machine. “The Antminer S19 is a 110TH/s machine, so Solo CK could have even been mining with just one overclocked rig. More likely, it was five or six Antminer S9 units. Either way, it could very easily be a home miner,” he said.
A machine’s hash rate refers to how many hashes, or mathematical equations, it can solve per second. On average, a new Bitcoin block is mined every 10 minutes. Kolivas estimated the chances weren’t quite so high, with a one in 10,000 chance of finding a block per day with that hash rate, but added the miner probably wouldn’t repeat the feat.
“For the miner involved, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime chance,” Kolivas wrote.
“It’s usually larger miners that solve blocks statistically, but there is no reason even the smallest miner can’t solve one.”
He noted a small miner in his pool had solved a block about one year ago."

A blog post accompanying the survey highlights new risks associated with the growing interconnectedness between digital assets and financial markets. Penned by IMF Monetary and Capital Markets Department director Tobias Adrian and economist Tara Iyer as well as research deputy division chief Mahvash Qureshi, the article claims that the increasing correlation between crypto assets and stocks “limits their perceived risk diversification benefits and raises the risk of contagion across financial markets.”
“Crypto assets such as Bitcoin have matured from an obscure asset class with few users to an integral part of the digital asset revolution,” the article reads, adding that this transition comes along with financial stability concerns.
Noting that BTC and Ether (ETH) rarely correlated with major stock indexes before the pandemic, the authors agreed that crypto assets helped diversify risk for investors by acting as a hedge against swings in other asset classes. “But this changed after the extraordinary central bank crisis responses of early 2020,” the authors wrote, adding that crypto and stocks surged hand in hand as investors’ risk appetite grew.

The correlation coefficient between BTC and the S&P 500 has jumped 3,600%, going from 0.01 to 0.36 after April 2020. This means that the two asset classes have been more closely rising and falling together since the coronavirus pandemic began.

With stronger correlation comes greater risks for Bitcoin, according to IMF experts. The growing interconnectedness between crypto and equity markets would permit the transmission of shocks that can destabilize financial markets. Noting that crypto assets are no longer on the fringe of the financial system, the authors summarized:
“Given their relatively high volatility and valuations, their increased co-movement could soon pose risks to financial stability especially in countries with widespread crypto adoption.”
The experts further called for a coordinated global regulatory framework “to guide national regulation and supervision and mitigate the financial stability risks stemming from the crypto ecosystem.”
Last month, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath made a similar call for a global policy regarding crypto. She argued that if countries were to ban crypto, then they would not have any control over offshore exchanges that are not subject to their country’s regulations."

The key takeaways touched upon miners’ behavior and Bitcoin (BTC) network adoption.
In the annual report released last week, the group shared some insights into the world of BTC mining:
“As Bitcoin miners have the most financial incentive tho make the best guess as to the adoption and value of BTC (...) the current bitcoin cycle is far from over and these miners are making investments for the long haul.”
The report stated that the recovery in the hash rate in 2021 “was truly astounding,” particularly when considering that the world’s second-largest economy, China, banned Bitcoin in 2021. The rebound in hash rate since the ban thanks to BTC’s hash power being “more widely distributed around the world,” showed miners are set on long-term profits.
The statements aligned with miners’ recent selling performance. Key on-chain metric indicate Bitcoin miners are in “massive” BTC accumulation mode, as miners show no desire to sell.

When it came to orange-pilling entire countries, Fidelity made some interesting predictions into more nation-states accepting BTC as legal tender:
“There i​​s very high-stakes game theory at play here, whereby if Bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some Bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. We, therefore, wouldn't be surprised to see other sovereign nation-states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.”
Their comments come as Tonga’s former MP suggested the country could adopt BTC in late 2022.
In essence, more regulation and better products will open up the crypto space, “bringing a greater portion of the hundreds of trillions in traditional assets into the digital asset ecosystem.” Combined with miners' hodling, it could lengthen the cycle and drive BTC to new highs."
7,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Taylor Locke,www.cnbc.com,Block 'officially building an open bitcoin mining system',"Jack Dorsey confirmed plans that Block will build an ""open bitcoin mining system.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/13/jack-dorsey-block-officially-building-an-open-bitcoin-mining-system.html,"Block founder and CEO Jack Dorsey just confirmed that the company, formerly known as Square, plans to move forward with plans to build a bitcoin mining system.
""We're officially building an open bitcoin mining system,"" Dorsey tweeted on Thursday. The company first announced that it was considering the project in October.
The project's goal is to make mining bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, ""more distributed and efficient,"" tweeted Thomas Templeton, the company's general manager for hardware.
Bitcoin operates on a proof of work (PoW) model, where miners must compete to solve complex puzzles in order to validate transactions. The process isn't easy: It requires a lot of energy and computer power, which isn't cheap. The computers themselves, along with other equipment, can also be very expensive.
Templeton mentioned that there are a number of ""customer pain points"" and ""technical challenges"" in the mining community that Block hopes to address, including mining rig availability, high price, reliability and power consumption.
""For most people, mining rigs are hard to find. Once you've managed to track them down, they're expensive and delivery can be unpredictable,"" Templeton tweeted. ""How can we make it so that anyone, anywhere, can easily purchase a mining rig?"" he said. ""We want to build something that just works. What can we simplify to make this a reality?""
Templeton said that Block is developing a hardware team of engineers and software designers to assess these questions. ""Developing products is never a solo journey, and evaluating existing tech is always part of our practice,"" he said.
This announcement isn't surprising. After all, it's no secret that Dorsey loves and owns bitcoin.
Before floating the idea of Block (then Square) building a mining system in October, Dorsey also said in August that he's ""trying"" to mine bitcoin himself.
""Mining isn't accessible to everyone,"" Dorsey tweeted in October. ""Bitcoin mining should be as easy as plugging a rig into a power source.""
Bitcoin is currently trading at around $42,598, according to Coin Metrics.

8,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Condé Nast,Andy Greenberg",www.wired.com,North Korean Hackers Stole Nearly $400 Million in Crypto Last Year,"The regime had a “banner year,” thanks to skyrocketing cryptocurrency values and a new generation of vulnerable startups.",https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-cryptocurrency-theft-ethereum/,"The past year saw a breathtaking rise in the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with Bitcoin gaining 60 percent in value in 2021 and Ethereum spiking 80 percent. So perhaps it's no surprise that the relentless North Korean hackers who feed off that booming crypto economy had a very good year as well.
North Korean hackers stole a total of $395 million worth of crypto coins last year across seven intrusions into cryptocurrency exchanges and investment firms, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. The nine-figure sum represents a nearly $100 million increase over the previous year's thefts by North Korean hacker groups, and it brings their total haul over the past five years to $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency alone—not including the uncounted hundreds of millions more the country has stolen from the traditional financial system. That hoard of stolen cryptocurrency now contributes significantly to the coffers of Kim Jong-un's totalitarian regime as it seeks to fund itself—and its weapons programs—despite the country's heavily sanctioned, isolated, and ailing economy.
""They've been very successful,"" says Erin Plante, a senior director of investigations at Chainalysis, whose report calls 2021 a ""banner year"" for North Korean cryptocurrency thefts. The findings show that North Korea's global, serial robberies have accelerated even in the midst of an attempted law enforcement crackdown; the US Justice Department, for instance, indicted three North Koreans in absentia in February of last year, accusing them of stealing at least $121 million from cryptocurrency businesses along with a slew of other financial crimes. Charges were also brought against a Canadian man who had allegedly helped to launder the funds. But those efforts haven't stopped the hemorrhaging of crypto wealth. ""We were excited to see actions against North Korea from law enforcement agencies,"" Plante says, ""yet the threat persists and is growing.""
The Chainalysis numbers, based on exchange rates at the time the money was stolen, don't merely point to an appreciation of cryptocurrency's value. The growth in stolen funds also tracks with the number of thefts last year; the seven breaches Chainalysis tracked in 2021 amount to three more than in 2020, though fewer than the 10 successful attacks that North Korean hackers carried out in 2018, when they stole a record $522 million.
For the first time since Chainalysis began tracking North Korean cryptocurrency thefts, Bitcoin no longer represents anywhere near the majority of the country's take, accounting for only around 20 percent of the stolen funds. Fully 58 percent of the groups' cryptocurrency gains came instead in the form of stolen ether, the Ethereum network's currency unit. Another 11 percent, around $40 million, came from stolen ERC-20 tokens, a form of crypto asset used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
Chainalysis's Plante attributes that increased focus on Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies—$272 million in total thefts last year versus $161 million in 2020—to the skyrocketing price of assets in the Ethereum economy, combined with the nascent companies that growth has fostered. ""Some of these exchanges and trading platforms are just newer and potentially more vulnerable to these types of intrusions,"" she says, ""They're trading heavily in ether and ERC-20 tokens, and they're just easier targets."""

Holding cash today in the inflationary environment for a client is a guaranteed recipe to lose purchasing power – while the exact opposite has been true over the years for bitcoin. Money needs to have demand for it to have value. According to a recent report from Grayscale, 25% of investors with $10,000 or more in investable assets own bitcoin. (Editor’s note: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.) The demand for bitcoin is increasing, according to Glassnode, as are on-chain analytics as more and more entities begin to own bitcoin."

Raised on the remote Shetland archipelago, he left school at 13 to become a trawlerman before moving into construction, eventually earning £85,000 a year digging tunnels for Crossrail.
Despite his self-made success, compulsive cryptocurrency trading, alcohol and drug use took over his life.
In the fog of multiple addictions, he lost the “addresses” of between five and 10 bitcoins, rendering his digital buried treasure – worth up to £300,000 today – impossible to retrieve.
Q&A What is cryptocurrency? Show Cryptocurrencies are an alternative way of making payments to cash or credit cards. The technology behind it allows the ‘money’ to be sent directly to others without it having to pass through the banking system. For that reason they are outside the control of governments and are unregulated by financial watchdogs – and transactions can be made in a way that keeps you reasonably pseudonymous. If you own a crypto-asset you control a secret digital key that you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of that asset is yours. If you spend it, you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it, and use the same key to prove that you are telling the truth. Over time, the history of all those transactions becomes a lasting record of who owns what: that record is called the blockchain. Bitcoin was one of the first and biggest cryptocurrencies and has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009, sometimes surging in value as investors have piled in – and recently crashing back down. Sceptics warn that the lack of central control make crypto-assets ideal for criminals and terrorists, while libertarian monetarists enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank. The whole concept of cryptocurrencies has been criticised for its ecological impact, with ""mining"" for new coins requiring vast energy reserves and the associated carbon footprint of the whole system.

Steven spotted the potential of bitcoin early and he had a talent for trading. But even if he had that money now, his addiction means it would soon be squandered.
“Trading is gambling, there’s no doubt about it,” he says.
“I studied and studied. I taught myself how to be a good trader and tried really hard to manage my accounts and stick to a set of rules.
“But my mind would twist and I’d go all in, like a poker player that thought he had the perfect hand. I was convinced I was going to be a bitcoin millionaire.”
Now in recovery at the Castle Craig residential treatment clinic in Scotland, Steven fears that legions of young people are being lured into high-risk trading and potentially addiction, based on the same misguided quest for untold riches.
“A whole generation think that with a little mobile phone they can win, that they can … beat the market,” he says.
“It scares the bejesus out of me.”

Steven’s fears are founded partly on crypto’s rapid emergence into the mainstream.
When he started investing in 2015, digital currencies meant nothing to most people.
Now, they are being touted as a more democratic alternative to a monopolistic and exploitative global financial system.
As the Guardian revealed on Friday today, crypto firms launched a record-breaking promotional push in London last year, targeting millions of commuters with 40,000 adverts on billboards, at tube stations, in carriages and across the side of double decker buses.
Advertisers included relatively obscure names such as Hex, Kraken and Puglife about whom consumers know little, if anything.
Meanwhile, football clubs and players, not to mention globally recognised celebrities, tout crypto investments on a daily basis via social media.
This week, reality TV star Kim Kardashian West and boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr were named in a lawsuit alleging that they helped promote crypto firm EthereumMax, as it made “false and misleading” statements that left investors nursing heavy losses.
An Instagram post about EthereumMax, to Kardashian’s 250 million followers, may have been the most widely seen financial promotion of all time, according to the head of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Yet despite their ascendancy – and warnings that governments could suffer “limitless” losses – cryptoassets remain unregulated in the UK, pending a Treasury review.
That means that the FCA, the UK’s financial regulator, is all but powerless to influence how the industry behaves.
While some trading platforms that offer digital assets are regulated – because they also offer more traditional financial instruments – crypto coins and tokens are not.
Cryptoasset executives do not have to prove that they are fit and proper people to take people’s money. The companies they run are not required to hold enough cash to repay investors if they go bust. Nor must they worry about the FCA’s stipulation that financial promotions, such as those splashed across public transport in London, are fair, clear and not misleading.
Amid the marketing blitz, the Advertising Standards Authority is the only watchdog that has bared its teeth. It is investigating one advert by the cryptocurrency Floki Inu and has already banned one for Luno Money.

“If you’re seeing bitcoin on a bus, it’s time to buy,” the Luno advert insisted, contrary to prevailing investment wisdom.
Luno Money told the Guardian it would welcome an “effective regulatory framework”.
But in the ongoing vacuum of oversight, experts fear that cautionary tales of addiction, such as the one told by Steven, are being drowned out by powerful, overwhelmingly positive messages.
To monitor the type of messaging sent out by marketing teams, the Guardian created an experimental cryptocurrency portfolio – holding a mixture of bitcoin, ether and Shiba Inu.
As bitcoin slumped towards the end of 2021 and into 2022, having reached all-time highs just weeks earlier, the Twitter account of smartphone trading app eToro remained doggedly optimistic.
“Is bitcoin on its way to a new high?,” it asked, as the slide began. “We’ve seen bitcoin rally before. But could this be the one to take it to the MOON?”
The answer, for the time being at least, was “No”. But holders of crypto portfolios were encouraged to stay positive.
“Your account gained 1.87% yesterday,” one app notification read, as the slump abated. “You had a good day. Share the news with everyone.”
No such invitation appeared on the far more frequent days when the value of the Guardian’s portfolio went down.
“It’s a very strategic marketing ploy,” says Dr Anna Lembke, one of the world’s foremost addiction experts, professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of the book Dopamine Nation.
“They’re encouraging you to amplify the wins and ignore the losses, creating a false impression there are more wins.”
Asked about this, eToro says that it is “committed to helping retail investors engage with each other and foster an environment of learning and collaboration”, adding that its platform is not “gamified”.
According to eToro’s UK managing director, Dan Moczulski, some users make their account public so that “all investments are visible to others, whether they are profitable or not”.
The company said it also provides educational tools, performs know-your-customer checks and encourages long-term, diversified investing.
But Dr Lembke is concerned by the potential for the social media element to fuel compulsive behaviour in crypto trading, an activity she says bears the hallmarks of addictive gambling products but without the acknowledged risk.
“When you mix social media with financial platforms, you make a new drug that’s even more potent,” she says.
Social media posts pushing crypto frequently refer to Fomo – the fear of missing out – fuelling an urge to participate.
“You get this herd mentality where people talk to each other about what the market is doing, they have wins together, losses together, … an intense shared emotional experience.”
“We get a little spike in dopamine, followed by a little deficit that has us looking to recreate that state.”
This, she says, echoes characteristics of gambling but with a crucial difference.
“It’s less stigmatised,” she says. “It has this socially sanctioned status as something that maverick smart people do.”
Parallels with gambling are becoming harder to ignore.
GamCare, which runs the National Gambling Helpline, said it fields about 20 calls a week related to crypto. Callers reported trading for 16 hours a day, making huge losses and struggling to cope with the guilt.
As with gambling, where every one addict is estimated to harm seven other people, many were suffering at the hands of someone else’s habit.
One recounted how her partner’s trading obsession was leading them to spend time away from the family. Another said their partner had taken to trading while in recovery from alcoholism, spending every waking hour making trades.
GamCare has even dealt with young patients who bought digital coins in a desperate attempt to make enough money to get on to the property ladder, only to lose life-changing sums.

At Castle Craig, where Steven is receiving treatment, the first crypto addict arrived at the clinic in 2016, followed by more than 100 since then.
“More and more people are isolated and are doing this [trading], especially since Covid,” says Tony Marini, the senior specialist therapist at the clinic and a recovering gambling addict himself.
“It’s tenfold already since 2016, so what’s it going to be like in the next five years?”"

Bitcoin’s hashrate has been riding high again as the processing power tapped another lifetime high on January 15, 2022, reaching 219.68 exahash per second (EH/s). The new record follows the previous all-time high (ATH) on the first day of the year, when the network’s hashrate tapped 219.5 EH/s.
Bitcoin’s Hashrate Hits a Milestone, Analyst Discusses Miner Capitulation, Estimated Bitcoin Production Cost
Bitcoin miners are dedicating a lot of SHA256 processing power to the BTC network on January 15, as the network quickly reached an ATH just after 12:00 a.m. (EST). The record was just a hair above the previous ATH on January 1, at 219.5 EH/s as today’s hashrate reached a high of 219.68 EH/s. At the time of writing, the network’s hashpower is coasting along at 199 EH/s.
The rise follows the recent drop in hashrate that happened while citizens of Kazakhstan revolted against the government and the internet was temporarily shut off in the country. It was widely speculated that the hashrate dropped 15% because of the issues in Kazakhstan but miners in the region claimed this was not the case. Data indicated at the time that BTC’s price drop and mining difficulty increase contributed to the 15% loss in hashrate.
In addition to the price drop and difficulty increase, estimates say the production cost to mine a single BTC today is $34K. Twitter account and analyst Venture Founder recently explained that the production cost price point is around 20% below the current value. “The worst dumps bitcoin ever had, were due to miners’ capitulation (Dec 2018, Mar 2020), when bitcoin fell below production costs, it is at risk for miner capitulation,” the analyst tweeted. Venture Founder added:
[Bitcoin] was at risk for miner capitulation at $30k in May. The current production cost is $34k, 20% below [the] current price.
Bitcoin’s Mining Difficulty Expected to Increase 3.8% in 5 Days to New All-Time High
While it was expected to happen two weeks ago, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty will likely reach an all-time high during the next epoch change. The next difficulty change is expected to happen in just over 5 days from now and estimates indicate it might rise 3.83% higher than it is today. If it does rise to that point and reaches 25.31 trillion, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty will reach another lifetime high.
The last mining difficulty ATH of 25 trillion was on May 13, 2021, and four difficulty decreases — including the largest epoch decrease ever — dropped the difficulty down a great deal. Since then, and after July 17, there’s been a total of 12 difficulty increases and just one decrease.
On Saturday, the largest bitcoin mining pool is F2pool with 15.57% or 28.88 EH/s and the second-largest pool is Foundry USA with 15.55% or 28.80 EH/s. Both pools have been jumping back and forth during the last few weeks in terms of Bitcoin’s largest mining pool.
What do you think about the recent hashrate high recorded on January 15, 2022, and the upcoming mining difficulty ATH that is expected to happen in five days? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

The bitcoin price, hitting an all-time high of almost $70,000 per bitcoin in November, has since crashed back, losing around 40% of its value and wiping $1 trillion from the combined crypto market.
Now, Wall Street giant Fidelity has said other countries and even a central bank could follow El Salvador and Tesla into bitcoin this year—predicting those that buy bitcoin while the price is low ""will be better off competitively than their peers.""

""There is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers,"" Fidelity analysts Chris Kuiper and Jack Neureuter wrote in a note, adding they ""wouldn't be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.""
""I agree with Fidelity, of course, but still astonishing to read this on bitcoin adoption game theory in such a mainstream financial report,"" bitcoin advocate Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation, said via Twitter.
In September, El Salvador made bitcoin its official currency alongside the U.S. dollar and began buying bitcoin. This year, the country has said it will buy another $500 million worth of bitcoin, funded by the issuance of $1 billion worth of tokenized bonds, and plans to create an ultra low tax ""Bitcoin City.""
Politicians in other countries are watching El Salvador's bitcoin experiment for signs of success and some have said they'd consider a similar move if it pays off.
This week, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro reportedly said he plans to allocate 1% of the city's treasury reserves to cryptocurrencies while in the U.S. the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, last year said he wants to put some of the city's treasury into bitcoin.
Meanwhile, Elon Musk's Tesla followed business software company MicroStrategy MSTR in adding bitcoin to its corporate treasury last year, kicking off a wave of similar corporate acquisitions.

The ostensible first cryptocurrency ATM machine has been installed in Uruguay, developed as a joint initiative between Urubit and Inbierto, two national crypto companies. This represents a milestone for the country, which according to estimates has between 40K and 50K cryptocurrency users, whose primary avenue for purchasing crypto relies on peer-to-peer markets.
Uruguay Enters the Crypto ATM Era
Uruguay has received its reported first cryptocurrency ATM in its territory, which is already installed in Punta del Este, a city located in the southeast of the country. The cryptocurrency machine was developed by two national crypto companies: Urubit and Inbierto. The former focused on the software part of the system, and the latter provided the hardware for the ATM.
Adolfo Varela, Inbierto’s CEO, states that one of the aims of this machine is to create trust in the cryptocurrency market in the country, where most crypto commerce happens in peer-to-peer markets that cannot go through banking due to lack of regulations. With a cryptocurrency ATM, the possibility of being victim to a scam is said to be eliminated. Varela believes they will keep growing and extending their crypto ATM network across the country. He stated:
We intend to continue growing in Maldonado, then Colonia, Montevideo and by the end of the year we want to have coverage throughout the national territory. With this it has happened to us that other countries have consulted us to be able to install it.
The installed crypto ATM supports only five cryptocurrencies (which include two national tokens): ferret token, urubit, bitcoin, binance coin (BNB), and binance USD (BUSD). The companies have not introduced Ethereum support to the machines because they rely on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to process transactions. Varela explained that Ethereum’s fees would deter users from using the machine, and that’s why BSC integration was opted for instead.
Regulation a Gray Area in the Country
Cryptocurrency regulation remains as a gray area in the country, but the central bank issued a statement in October last year, declaring these assets were not legal or illegal, and that citizens could use them while being aware of the risks they carry.
In a document issued in December, the Central Bank of Uruguay establishes a roadmap for regulating crypto assets, proposing to review current laws and make changes to include them in various existing regulations, instead of creating a virtual asset law to encompass the universe of these assets in just one project.

14,2022-01-15,2022-01-15,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Mackenzie Sigalos,www.cnbc.com,How HIFO accounting reduces IRS bill,"The HIFO (short for highest in, first out) accounting method can significantly slash an investor's tax obligation.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/15/bitcoin-tax-loophole-how-hifo-accounting-reduces-irs-bill.html,"Bitcoin is down around 36% from its all-time high in November, but the dip has a good side, thanks to a quirk in the tax code that helps crypto holders shield their winnings from the IRS.
The IRS treats cryptocurrencies like property, meaning that anytime you spend, exchange, or sell your tokens, you're logging a taxable event. There's always a difference between how much you paid for your crypto, which is the cost basis, and the market value at the time you spend it. That difference can trigger capital gains taxes.
But a little-known accounting method known as HIFO — short for highest in, first out — can significantly slash an investor's tax obligation.
When you sell your crypto, you can pick and choose the specific unit you are selling. That means a crypto holder can pick out the most expensive bitcoin they bought and use that number to determine their tax obligation. A higher cost basis translates to less tax on your sale.
But the onus is on the user to keep track, so thorough bookkeeping is essential. Without detailed records of a taxpayer's transaction and cost basis, calculations to the IRS can't be substantiated.
""People rarely use it because it requires keeping good records or using crypto software,"" explained Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. ""But the thing is, lots of folks now use that kind of software, which makes this kind of accounting super easy. They just don't know it exists.""
The trick to HIFO accounting is keeping granular details about every crypto transaction you made for each coin you own, including when you purchased it and for how much, as well as when you sold it and the market value at that time.
But if you don't have all transaction records logged, or you're not using the right kind of software, the accounting method defaults to something called FIFO, or first in, first out.
""It's not ideal,"" Chandrasekera explains.
Under FIFO accounting rules, when you sell your tokens, you're selling the earliest purchased coin. If you bought your crypto before its big price run-up in 2021, your low cost basis can mean a bigger capital gains tax bill."
15,2022-01-16,2022-01-16,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Daniel Boffey,www.theguardian.com,Panic as Kosovo pulls the plug on its energy-guzzling bitcoin miners,Speculators rush to sell off their kit as Balkan state announces a crypto clampdown to ease electricity crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/16/panic-as-kosovo-pulls-the-plug-on-its-energy-guzzling-bitcoin-miners,"For bitcoin enthusiasts in Kosovo with a breezy attitude to risk, it has been a good week to strike a deal on computer equipment that can create, or “mine”, the cryptocurrency.
From Facebook to Telegram, new posts in the region’s online crypto groups became dominated by dismayed Kosovans attempting to sell off their mining equipment – often at knockdown prices.
“There’s a lot of panic and they’re selling it or trying to move it to neighbouring countries,” said cryptoKapo, a crypto investor and administrator of some of the region’s largest online crypto communities.
The frenetic social media action follows an end-of-year announcement by Kosovo’s government of an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on all crypto mining activity as part of emergency measures to ease a crippling energy crisis.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or “mined” by high-powered computers that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in what is a highly energy-intensive process that rewards people based on the amount of computing power they provide.
The incentive to get into the mining game in Kosovo, one of Europe’s poorest countries, is obvious. The cryptocurrency currently trades at more than £31,500 a bitcoin, while Kosovo has the cheapest energy prices in Europe due in part to more than 90% of the domestic energy production coming from burning the country’s rich reserves of lignite, a low-grade coal, and fuel bills being subsidised by the government.
The largest-scale crypto mining is thought to be taking place in the north of the country, where the Serb-majority population refuse to recognise Kosovo as an independent state and have consequently not paid for electricity for more than two decades.
There is serious money to be made – and in a time of ready energy supply it was being made. The number of people mining cryptocurrencies in Kosovo is thought to have skyrocketed in recent years. Groups such as Albanian Crypto Amateurs on Facebook and Crypto Eagles on Telegram have exploded with thousands of new members, though it is unclear how many are mining cryptocurrency, or on what scale.
But the good times appear to be over – at least for now – and the developments in Kosovo highlight one of the big questions about the future of bitcoin and other such digital currency.
The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that global bitcoin mining consumes 125.96 terawatt hours a year of electricity, putting its consumption above Norway (122.2 TWh), Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh).

Meanwhile, Kosovans spent the final days of 2021 in darkness as domestic and international factors combined to cause energy shortages and rolling blackouts across the country. At the peak of the recent crisis, an unforeseen shutdown at one of its two ageing power plants left Kosovo importing about 40% of its energy on international markets – where prices have soared – and the government was forced to provide an emergency subsidy to help meet the costs.
Kosovo’s minister of economy, Dr Artane Rizvanolli, said the ban had been a “no-brainer”.
“We have allocated €20m for subsidising energy, which is probably not going to be sufficient, and this is taxpayers’ money that is going to subsidise electricity consumption,” she said. “On the other hand we have crypto mining, which is a highly energy-intensive activity and is not regulated.”
Kosovo is not alone. Last September, the 10 most powerful regulators in China vowed to kill off what was then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency mining industry.
In Iceland, the country’s national power company, Landsvirkjun, has said it will turn away potential cryptocurrency miners as the country is experiencing power shortages. Last week, a powerful committee in the US Congress announced it would convene a hearing on the issue. US cryptocurrency miners are believed to be the largest consumers of energy, followed by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.
“It’s time to understand and address the steep energy and environmental impacts it is having on our communities and our planet,” said committee chairman Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette, who heads its oversight panel.
Alex de Vries, a Paris-based economist, said his initial estimates in a paper to be published later this year suggest just a quarter of the energy used by miners is renewable: “The question really is: what are you getting in return for that?”
Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, said he believed there were a host of advantages, including the offer of instant, virtually free, financial transactions carried out without the use of a third party, with certainty that there will be instant settlement, and that the current teething problems need to be put in perspective.
Since the Kosovan authorities made the decision, police and customs officers have begun conducting regular raids, seizing hundreds of pieces of hardware.
While a 60-day state of energy emergency remains in place, the prospect of upcoming regulation and energy bill price rises leaves the future anything but certain.
“There are a lot of people who have invested in crypto mining equipment and it’s not a small investment,” cryptoKapo said. “People have even taken out loans to invest and the impact now is very bad on their lives.”"
16,2022-01-16,2022-01-16,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Pavel Ibarra Meda,www.marca.com,Bitcoin price news: Will the cryptocurrency hit 'new highs' this year despite it's rough start?,Bitcoin didn't have the best start of the year but the stats suggest it has finally stabilized this week and it might even be on its way to another massive rise. After adding,https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2022/01/17/61e49c9546163fc49c8b45c4.html,"Bitcoin didn't have the best start of the year but the stats suggest it has finally stabilized this week and it might even be on its way to another massive rise. After adding 1% since last Sunday, the biggest cryptocurrency on the market is slowly recovering after dropping 12% during the initial week of 2022. If we take the first week of 2021 and compare it to this one, we can see Bitcoin last year made a massive gain of 15% and traded above $50,000 per coin. Although this week's improvement look minuscule, experts on the matter are convinced Bitcoin will be on the rise again over the next couple of weeks.
Currently, Bitcoin price sits at a ""low"" $42,000 per coin but experts are suggesting it might jump between $50,000 to $60,000 in the next few weeks. The reason for this jump, according to CEO of Panxora Gavin Smith, is the looming inflation. It's all about a ""real"" interest rate that will be adjusted for inflation. When the figure is negative, it only means that consumer prices will keep on rising faster than benchmark bond yields. As investirs keep effectively losing value by holding bonds and other fixed-income instruments. This dynamic encourages risk-taking amid the function of ultra-loose monetary policies put in place by all central banks around the world.
Can Bitcoin set new highs in 2022?
According to the U.S. Labor Department, the Consumer Price Index had risen 7% in December compared to 12 months prior to that. It went up from the 6.8% that was registered during the month of November. This is actually the fastest annual increase since 1982. Even though Bitcoin has already recivered after going below $40,000 on Monday, ths rebound pales in comparison to bitcoin standards. It is believed that if the cryptocurrency breaks $45,500 this year, there might be another sharp move higher than ever before in modern history. It might all happen during 2022."
17,2022-01-16,2022-01-16,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,www.politico.com,Bitcoin crashes the midterms,"Candidates are staking out positions on cryptocurrency, scrambling party lines and fanning fundraising concerns.",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/16/bitcoin-crashes-the-midterms-527126,"Aarika Rhodes, an elementary school teacher mounting a left-leaning primary challenge against California Democrat Brad Sherman, the most prominent critic of cryptocurrency in the House, is promoting the technology in her run. She said she has taken several thousand dollars worth of donations in cryptocurrency to date, having embraced it after talking to voters and hearing from crypto advocates who urged her to draw a distinction with Sherman on the issue.
“More and more people of color, women, single moms are looking into Bitcoin,” the largest cryptocurrency, Rhodes said. “I never met anyone who was against it.”
Roughly one in six Americans have personally traded, used or invested in cryptocurrency, according to Pew Research Center, including 13 percent of white, 18 percent of Black, 21 percent of Hispanic and 23 percent of Asian Americans.
So far, the political incentives around cryptocurrency are proving lopsided. More candidates have found reason to embrace a technology backed by legions of devoted users, a fresh crop of newly rich donors, and a growing number of lobbyists, than to vocally reject it.
“Look, it just seems cool. Everybody’s got a friend who’s made some money on it. There’s a lobbyist who wants to take me to lunch,” said Sherman, who has called for banning cryptocurrency outright, of the hype that has made it popular with his colleagues on the Hill. Shunning the technology, on the other hand, has brought the congressman few immediate rewards. In addition to facing a crypto-fueled primary challenge, he has inspired the creation of a new super PAC, Shut Down Sherman, “dedicated to taking down Enemy Number 1 to Crypto.”
Sherman bemoaned a lack of political interest in what he sees as the emerging threats from crypto, such as its potential to undermine U.S.-imposed financial sanctions and the U.S. dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.
“That is worth hundreds of billions of dollars to American families, and there’s no lobbyist in this city that protects it,” he said. “No lobbyist is fighting for the ability to go after criminals with sanctions.”
Ron Hammond, director of government relations at the Blockchain Association and an advisor to the pro-crypto HODL PAC, said that rather than fielding concerns about crypto, he is more likely to receive requests for advice. Congressional staffers from both parties want help, he said, drafting pro-crypto tweets for their bosses, who see that the subject can generate frenzied social media engagement.
The website for the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, which was formed to foster the accounting technology underlying cryptocurrency, lists 18 Republican and 17 Democratic lawmakers. Sherman, though, is not alone in taking a hard line on the crypto boom.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has called for Congress to do more to regulate the industry. She is also among the Democrats calling for a crackdown on the carbon emissions associated with some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, which relies on vast numbers of specialized computers competing to solve mathematical puzzles as part of an energy-intensive process that secures its network.
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have both spoken out against cryptocurrency on account of its potential to undermine the dollar’s global dominance.
In June, Trump likened Bitcoin to a “scam,” telling Fox Business Network, “The currency of this world should be the dollar. And I don’t think we should have all of the Bitcoins of the world out there. I think they should regulate them very, very high.”
Younger politicians are less likely to prioritize such concerns. “I don’t know a single Republican under the age of 50 who’s critical of crypto,” said Hammond, who previously worked for Republican Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio. Hammond said that some older members of the party quietly oppose cryptocurrency adoption but have hesitated to express public opposition.
The technology has even split the Trump family along generational lines. Former first lady Melania Trump, 51, posted a tweet this month in honor of Bitcoin’s 13th birthday, as she launches her own line of non-fungible tokens, digital collectibles that rely on the same blockchain technology that enables cryptocurrencies.
While those who deal on the world stage are more likely to see crypto as a threat to the U.S.-led global financial order, many mayors — like Eric Adams of New York and Francis Suarez of Miami — have embraced crypto as a way to attract attention, and potentially jobs, to their cities.
The technology is also inspiring candidates who have made money from it to mount crypto-themed runs for office. In Oregon’s newly created 6th District, Matt West, a DeFi — or decentralized finance, a new form of lending enabled by blockchain technology — developer, is running as a pro-crypto Democrat. On the heels of a quixotic independent presidential bid, Brock Pierce, a former child actor turned crypto entrepreneur, is exploring a run for the Vermont Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Patrick Leahy.
As the total value of cryptocurrencies has exploded to more than $2 trillion in recent years, those made rich by the boom have begun to throw their weight around as donors, too. Last year, the second-largest individual donor to Joe Biden’s presidential election efforts was Sam Bankman-Fried, the 29-year-old founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried gave more than $5 million but evinced little interest in scoring a meeting with the beneficiary of his largesse.
As Congress and the Biden administration begin to grapple in earnest with the implications of cryptocurrency on a range of policy fronts, crypto donors are becoming more strategic. On New Year’s Eve, Jesse Powell, the CEO of Kraken, another exchange, issued a public call for lists of candidates who support cryptocurrency and of “crypto enemies.” The next day, he announced he had made maximum allowable contributions to 15 politicians, including Rhodes, Mandel and West.
Sam Cooper, a former deputy chief of staff to pro-crypto Sen. Ted Cruz who now advises crypto clients in the private sector, said donors are still getting their bearings this cycle, before what he anticipates will be a more organized effort in the next presidential election.
By then, Cooper said he expects crypto will have gone from a niche issue to a campaign trail staple. “Will Bitcoin become a core issue in 2022? No. It’s going to be inflation and immigration and the things we see everyday,” he said. “But I do expect in 2024, especially on the Republican side, that this will be an issue.”

The retailer sought several new trademarks in December that show it intends to make and sell virtual goods such as electronics, decor, toys, sporting goods and personal-care products.
The applications, which were first reported by CNBC, represent a significant step for the retail giant as it studies how to participate in the metaverse, a virtual world that blends aspects of digital technologies. Walmart in August advertised a position to develop “the digital currency strategy and product roadmap” while identifying “crypto-related investment and partnerships,” according to a job posting on the company’s website.
The applications were among a flurry the company filed on Dec. 30, including three under “Walmart Connect” — the name of the company’s existing digital advertising venture — for a financial exchange for virtual currency and advertising. Applications also were filed for “Verse to Store,” “Verse to Curb” and “Verse to Home” for shopping services. It’s also seeking trademarks to apply the Walmart name and “fireworks” logo to heath-care services and education in virtual and augmented reality.
A Walmart representative didn’t immediately comment on the filings.
All of the applications were filed indicating that the company intends to use them but has not yet begun doing so. The trademarks wouldn’t be registered until they are in actual use.
Walmart’s cryptocurrency plans were the subject of a high-profile hoax in September, when a fake announcement caused a short-lived surge in Litecoin, a relatively obscure cryptocurrency. According to the faked news release, Walmart would start letting its customers pay with Litecoin.
Even so, Walmart has continued to explore capabilities in that realm. In October, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer started a pilot program in which shoppers can buy Bitcoin at Coinstar kiosks in some of its U.S. stores. The test with Coinstar, which is known for the machines that let customers exchange U.S. coins for paper bills or gift cards, includes 200 kiosks in Walmart stores.
In early December, Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said at an analyst conference that the company was open to allowing shoppers to pay in cryptocurrency if customers demand it, but the company didn’t see a need to rush out any capabilities.

Ether purchases accounted for 15% of the total, stablecoins were 13% and new coins added to BitPay in 2021 — Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Litecoin — accounted for 3%",https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-dominance-of-crypto-payments-is-starting-to-erode-11642351742576.html,"Consumers and businesses are increasingly starting to use digital tokens other than Bitcoin for purchases, according to BitPay Inc., one of the biggest crypto payments processors in the world.
Last year, Bitcoin’s use at merchants that use BitPay dropped to about 65% of processed payments, down from 92% in 2020, the company told Bloomberg. Ether purchases accounted for 15% of the total, stablecoins were 13% and new coins added to BitPay in 2021 -- Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Litecoin -- accounted for 3%.
The alternative coins’ use surged partly as more businesses have begun using stablecoins for cross-border payments. Consumers also tend to move to stablecoins -- whose value is supposed to stay steady -- when crypto prices drop, and they’ve been falling since early November. Coins like Doge also made a splash last year, thanks to fans like Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk, who on Friday said the token can be used to buy the company’s merchandise.
With Bitcoin’s price rising 60% last year, despite the fourth-quarter volatility, many investors may also have chosen to hold onto the world’s biggest cryptocurrency instead of spending it. Many remember Bitcoin’s first commercial transaction, in which a programmer spent Bitcoins now worth billions on two pizza pies.
When they did spend their crypto, many bought luxury good like jewelry and watches, cars, boats -- and even (cover your ears) gold, which Bitcoin -- touted as digital gold -- is supposed to replace, according to BitPay. The Atlanta-based private company’s transaction volumes related to luxury goods surged 31% last year from 9% in 2020, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Pair. The company’s overall 2021 payment volumes rose 57% year over year.
BitPay was founded in 2011, when few companies accepted digital coins. Today it processes an average of about 66,000 transactions per month. That’s a tiny fraction of, say, Visa’s volume: The credit-card network processed 206 billion transactions in the year ended June 30, 2021.
BitPay, with its $1 billion in annual transaction volume and 80 employees, helps companies ranging from Microsoft Corp. to AT&T Inc. accept cryptocurrency payments.
It can also serve as an industry barometer. At least so far, the recent downturn hasn’t affected crypto investors’ spending habits as much as in the crypto winter of 2018, Pair said. While luxury spending has been hit, the overall declines have been much smaller, he said -- perhaps a sign of confidence that the current downturn could be short-lived, or that crypto has a much broader base of users.
“Our business ebbs and flows to some degree with the price, when the price goes down, people tend to spend less,"" Pair said. “We have not experienced as much of a decline in volume with this recent pullback. It’s probably just a reflection of more and more companies that need to use this as a tool to conduct payments.""
More merchants are accepting crypto payments now. Last year BitPay began working with VeriFone to accept digital coins at its terminals at various stores.
For its part, BitPay is showing signs of confidence as well. It just appointed Jim Lester its first-ever chief operating officer to expand the business. Lester previously headed startup ThingTech, and was also senior vice president of product management, strategy and marketing at Fiserv Inc.’s electronic billing and payments division.
A growing list of companies including PayPal Holdings Inc. are stepping into crypto payments as well, showing the payments market’s growth potential.
“PayPal getting into this space has been great for our business, because it causes companies to start asking the question of should they accept crypto payments,"" Pair said. BitPay had close to 50% revenue growth last year, he said.
The company has raised $72 million from the likes of Index Ventures and Founders Fund. It doesn’t expect to go public, raise another funding round or sell in the near term, though it has talked about an IPO internally, Pair said.
“We really like where we are strategically,"" Pair said. “This space is still very young. A lot of it has to do with what we think about timing. In the next couple of years we are likely to see very substantial growth."""
20,2022-01-17,2022-01-17,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Joanna Ossinger,www.aljazeera.com,Cardano is outperforming rivals Bitcoin and Ether,"Cardano’s ADA token has risen 30% in the past seven days, while Bitcoin, Ether, Solana and XRP advanced less than 5%.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/17/cardano-is-outperforming-rivals-bitcoin-and-ether,"Cardano’s ADA token has surged in the past week, even as the likes of Bitcoin and Ether traded sideways, amid some promising developments on its blockchain.
ADA has risen 30% in the past seven days, according to pricing from CoinGecko, while Bitcoin, Ether, Solana and XRP have advanced less than 5%. That comes as data from Messari show Cardano’s 24-hour transaction volume at $5.31 billion, compared with Ethereum’s $5.59 billion. But Cardano’s gas fees – payments made by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process transactions – were around $75,400 compared with the latter’s $44 million over that period.
“One could quite easily argue that the NFT market has found a gas-light way to transact, and that is the Cardano blockchain,” said Hayden Hughes, chief executive officer of Alpha Impact, a social-media platform for crypto traders. “Many have argued that it’s only a matter of time before gas fees and congestion clog up the Cardano blockchain, leading to high gas fees, but despite the $5.31 billion in daily activity we have not yet seen this.”

Cardano has had its ups and downs in recent months. For a time it was the third-biggest cryptocurrency, topped by only Bitcoin and Ether, and neared $100 billion in market value amid optimism about the addition of smart contract capabilities. However, it dropped after that and is about 50% below its early-September record, even with the recent rally. While Cardano has an enthusiastic fan base, it’s also got detractors. Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, posted on Twitter in August that “I spoke to twenty of the smartest people I know in the space, and zero of them saw Cardano having traction with devs.”
“ADA’s critics say there’s too much talk and not enough action,” said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner of Nexo. “Cardano’s position as Ethereum’s nemesis was somewhat usurped in 2021 by the rise of rival blockchains Solana and Avalanche,” he said, but “clearly there’s a passionate Cardano community eager for it to succeed, otherwise it wouldn’t be a top-five crypto.”
Recent developments on Cardano including in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens and the metaverse, as well as progress on scaling, are likely contributing to the optimism around the blockchain, according to Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia-Pacific at Luno Pte.
Trenchev agreed, citing the metaverse and decentralized exchanges as reasons for the enthusiasm.
“The planned launch of the first DEX – decentralized exchange – on the Cardano blockchain comes after it’s already established a presence in NFTs,” Trenchev said. “To top it off, Cardano is stealing some attention away from Decentraland and The Sandbox with news of the first Cardano metaverse (Pavia.io).”"

Filings reveal plans for a coin, NFTs","Walmart Inc. is preparing to create its own cryptocurrency and collection of non-fungible tokens, filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office show, setting the stage for meeting its customers in the emerging metaverse.",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-17/walmart-cryptocurrency-nft,"Walmart Inc. is preparing to create its own cryptocurrency and collection of nonfungible tokens, filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office show, setting the stage for meeting its customers in the emerging metaverse.
The retailer sought several new trademarks in December that show it intends to make and sell virtual goods such as electronics, decor, toys, sporting goods and personal-care products.
The applications, which were first reported by CNBC, represent a significant step for the retail giant as it studies how to participate in the metaverse, a virtual world that blends aspects of digital technologies. Walmart in August advertised a position to develop a “digital currency strategy and product roadmap” while identifying “crypto-related investment and partnerships,” according to a job posting on the company’s website.
The applications were among a flurry the company filed Dec. 30, including three under Walmart Connect — the name of the company’s existing digital advertising venture — for a financial exchange for virtual currency and advertising. Applications also were filed for Verse to Store, Verse to Curb and Verse to Home for shopping services. It’s also seeking trademarks to apply the Walmart name and fireworks logo to heathcare services and education in virtual and augmented reality.
“Walmart is continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We don’t have anything further to share today, but it’s worth noting we routinely file trademark applications as part of the innovation process.”

Here is a guide to the world of bitcoin, digital wallets, smart contracts and other key pieces of the crypto puzzle.
All of the applications were filed indicating that the company intends to use them but has not yet begun doing so. The trademarks wouldn’t be registered until they are in actual use.
Walmart’s cryptocurrency plans were the subject of a high-profile hoax in September, when a fake announcement caused a short-lived surge in Litecoin, a relatively obscure cryptocurrency. According to the faked news release, Walmart would start letting its customers pay with Litecoin.
Even so, Walmart has continued to explore capabilities in that realm. In October, the Bentonville, Ark., retailer started a pilot program in which shoppers can buy bitcoin at Coinstar kiosks in some of its U.S. stores. The test with Coinstar, which is known for the machines that let customers exchange U.S. coins for paper bills or gift cards, includes 200 kiosks in Walmart stores.
In early December, Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said at an analyst conference that the company was open to allowing shoppers to pay in cryptocurrency if customers demand it, but the company didn’t see a need to rush out any capabilities.

This includes placing any form of advertisements or promotional materials in public areas, such as public transport and related venues, public websites, broadcast and print media, and the provision of physical automated teller machines (ATMs).
Service providers should also not be engaging third parties, like social media influencers, for joint promotional campaigns to solicit new customers, said the central bank as it issued new guidelines to ""discourage"" cryptocurrency trading by the general public.
According to the guidelines, digital payment token service providers can only market or advertise on their own corporate websites, mobile apps or official social media accounts.
“MAS strongly encourages the development of blockchain technology and innovative application of crypto tokens in value-adding use cases. But the trading of cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public,” said the central bank’s assistant managing director for policy, payments and financial crime Loo Siew Yee.
""DPT service providers should therefore not portray the trading of DPTs in a manner that trivialises the high risks of trading in DPTs, nor engage in marketing activities that target the general public.”
Examples of digital payment tokens are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A digital payment token service includes the buying or selling, or providing a platform to allow people to exchange such tokens in Singapore.
The definition of such services will also be expanded to include the transfer of digital payment tokens and provision of custodian wallet services for such tokens when the amendments to the Payment Services Act take effect, said the central bank in a press release.
Digital payment token service providers include payment institutions, banks and other financial institutions, as well as applicants under the Payment Services Act.
So far, MAS has granted four firms the licence to provide digital payment token services out of a pool of about 180 applicants. They are local fintech firm Fomo Pay, Australian cryptocurrency exchange Independent Reserve, local bank DBSs brokerage arm DBS Vickers, and Singapore-based cryptocurrency payments provider Triple A.
Singapore's regulations of digital payment token service providers are geared primarily towards protection against money laundering and terrorism financing. Digital payment tokens are not subject to consumer protection measures."

A correction event now almost in its third month is frustrating many, but conditions may soon be right for a fresh charge against opportunistic bears, an increasing number of analysts are saying.
With inflation running hot and United States lawmakers set to make the Bitcoin mining debate public this week, there are plenty of potential pitfalls in store.
Nonetheless, it’s beginning to feel like Bitcoin is at the point where it is capable of producing a classic surprise when the majority of the mainstream economy least expects it.
Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors worth paying attention to when charting BTC price action over the coming week.
Bitcoin retains key weekly close level
Bitcoin looks decidedly uninterested in tackling even local resistance levels as the week begins.
After a rangebound weekend with little unique price action, BTC/USD is putting in lower lows on short timeframes while avoiding key zones around $44,000.
With Wall Street closed for a holiday, Monday could shape up to offer more of the same before markets provide direction.
Bitcoin did, however, manage to close out the week at exactly the crucial point identified by trader and analyst Rekt Capital as useful for aiding bullish momentum.
“A Weekly Close above ~$43100 (black) would be a good sign of confirmation for BTC to continue higher from here,” he wrote Sunday alongside an accompanying price chart.
“By turning black into support on the Weekly, $BTC would confirm a re-entry into its ~$43100-$51800 range.”

A subsequent dip took the largest cryptocurrency lower, with $42,337 on Bitstamp the local floor for Monday at the time of writing.
Also cautiously optimistic is fellow popular trader Crypto Ed, who is eyeing a potential replay of last week’s run above $44,000, something that bears subsequently quashed.
“Although it’s early but this looks like the start of continuation of last week’s move. Fingers crossed!” he summarized in part of his latest Twitter update.
Last week, meanwhile, Cointelegraph reported on sentiment favoring an upside breakout as an eventual outcome of the current ranging behavior.
Congress to discuss “cleaning up” crypto mining
The “stage is being set” in more ways than one this week as the topic of inflation returns to haunt U.S. markets and politics alike.
Amid a fresh flurry of headlines about how inflation is hitting consumers, the highest consumer price index (CPI) print in 40 years is already hitting President Joe Biden’s approval ratings.
Reining in the 7% year-on-year CPI increase could see the Federal Reserve enact no fewer than four key rate hikes in 2022 alone, Goldman Sachs forecast last week. This, in turn, places more pressure on weary consumers.
“The stage is being set in the coming weeks,” Pentoshi argued.
Closer to home, this week will see U.S. lawmakers discuss the alleged environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.
With a significant chunk of the Bitcoin hash rate now coming from the U.S., any hostile policies will matter more than most when it comes to sentiment. A repeat of the China exodus from May 2021 — and its knock-on effect for hash rate and network security — will not be welcomed by anyone.
The hash rate, as Cointelegraph noted, is now back at all-time highs, fully recovered from last year’s events.
The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing is due to take place on Thursday and is titled “Cleaning Up Cryptocurrency: The Energy Impacts of Blockchains.”
The hearing will be livestreamed in real time on the day.
Bitcoin “a bonfire covered in gasoline”
Bitcoin volatility is plumbing multi-year lows — encouraging for its acceptance as a mainstream asset, but not something many expect to last.
According to the Bitcoin Volatility Index, which calculates the standard deviation of daily BTC returns for the last 30 and 60 days, Bitcoin is at its least volatile since November 2020 at 2.63%.
Current price movements are thus similar to before BTC/USD entered price discovery after cracking its $20,000 all-time high from 2017.
For trader, entrepreneur and investor Bob Loukas, the stage is now set for a potential repeat of those events.
“Remember when everyone was loading up BTC options in Sept/Oct for the super cycle. Those are probably down 80+%,” he commented, noting that derivatives traders from before the current $69,000 all-time highs are likely more than disappointed.
“Vol dropping speaks to consolidating period, likely similar outcome period leading into Oct 20’ move. But think still time to grind in this BTC range.”

While “exciting” price moves are yet to reappear after December’s drawdown, however, they are now all the more likely thanks to Bitcoin’s supply becoming increasingly inaccessible.
“With illiquid supply at ATH’s for this cycle, Bitcoin is essentially a bonfire covered in gasoline,” market commentator Miles Johal argued.
“The slightest whiff of demand will bring roaring flames.”
As Cointelegraph reported, BTC is being ferreted away into cold storage out of the grip of speculators.
Interest “quiet ever since” early 2021
Amid questions over the absence of retail investors even after a 40% price drawdown, new data shows that the sector has in fact had little interest in Bitcoin for an entire year.
Eyeing new entities appearing on the blockchain, Glassnode analyst TXMC showed just how quiet Bitcoin has really been in terms of retail adoption since January 2021.
A look at the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of new entities coming on-chain reveals that the last major surge ended at the start of Q1 last year.
Since then, despite two new all-time price highs, new entity numbers have fallen and returned to standard rates normally seen after bull cycle peaks.
“Bitcoin bull/bear markets have a distinct on-chain activity profile,” TXMC explained on Twitter.
“Activity wise, the last bull run ended in January 2021. It’s been quiet ever since.”

The data underscores how the average investor has all but forgotten Bitcoin, even as it swept new highs and institutional activity remained strong.
Interest levels from Google users have added to the trend, with search rates for “Bitcoin” worldwide at levels previously the norm in December 2020.

Miners, although being far from underwater at current price levels, are also getting less income from transaction fees than at any point since late 2020 — just 1.08%.
“This is an indicator that retail is not in yet... Although price is really similar to early 2021 When retail?” Twitter-based on-chain analyst Blockwise queried this weekend, presenting further Glassnode data.

Be afraid, be “extremely” afraid
Bitcoin’s New Year “extreme fear” continues — and if on-chain behavior is anything to go by, it’s set to remain the dominant sentiment force.

According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment via a basket of factors to assess just how traders are likely to act at a given price point, things have rarely looked bleaker.
Since late December, the Index has characterized the status quo as “extreme fear,” and so far, no price shifts have managed to alter it.
The same is true this week, with Fear & Greed at 21/100 — well within the “extreme fear” bracket.

Similarly, data covering BTC moving at a profit or loss shows timidity among transactors, with precious little profiteering to be seen.
Such behavior is common during price dips and was seen last year during the summer as BTC/USD fell and bottomed at around $30,000.

According to BitPay, Bitcoin’s (BTC) usage at businesses that use its payment system fell last year to about 65% of processed transactions, down from 92% in 2020. Along with this change, Ether (ETH) represented 15% of all transactions, whereas other currencies such as Litecoin (LTC) and Dash have increased their portion.
Businesses have started using stablecoins more frequently for cross-border payments since November when crypto values had been depreciating. Consumers have also begun to use stablecoins because their value is constant, resulting in less risk in the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency market, as per the report.
The growing popularity of stablecoins has partly contributed to the use of alternative coins for payments. Dogecoin (DOGE), for example, became famous last year as the result of its followers, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who announced on Friday that DOGE may be used to buy Tesla-related merchandise.

The trend suggests that individuals are holding Bitcoin rather than spending it. Bitcoin’s prices increased by 60% in 2021, regardless of the fourth quarter’s volatility. According to BitPay, the majority of last year’s crypto transactions were in luxury items such as jewelry, watches and automobiles.

Adverts will be brought into line with other financial advertising, ensuring they are fair and clear
New rules will increase consumer protection while encouraging innovation
Around 2.3 million people in the UK are now thought to own a cryptoasset with their popularity rising - but research suggests that understanding of what crypto actually is is declining, suggesting that some users may not fully understand what they are buying. This poses a risk that these products could be mis-sold.
The consultation response, published today, sets out the government’s plan to bring the promotion of cryptoassets within the scope of financial promotions legislation. This means the promotion of qualifying cryptoassets will be subject to FCA rules in line with the same high standards that other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insurance products are held to.
This will balance the desire to encourage innovation with the need to ensure that cryptoasset advertisements are fair, clear, and not misleading.
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said:
Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest – but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims. We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.
The government is eager to support innovation in cryptoassets and recognises the potential benefits of certain products like stablecoins, such as providing a more efficient means of payment, and in 2018 the government launched the the Cryptoasset Taskforce, which continues to steer the UK’s regulatory response to the cryptoasset market.
However, research undertaken by the FCA highlighted the potential for misleading advertising of crypto products to cause consumer harm.
The Government’s decision to bring these types of advertisements into the scope of regulation will mitigate the risks of consumer harm, ensuring people have the appropriate information to make informed investment decisions.
This will be done via secondary legislation to amend the Financial Promotion Order, which sets out the investments and activities to which the financial promotion regime applies. Under the Financial Services and Markets act 2000, a business cannot promote a financial product unless they are authorised by the FCA or the PRA, or the content of the promotion is approved by a firm which is. Firms that wish to promote such investments and activities must comply with binding rules that financial promotions must be fair, clear, and not misleading.
This will provide the Financial Conduct Authority with the appropriate powers to regulate the market more effectively. The FCA will shortly be consulting on their proposed financial promotions rules that will apply to cryptoassets.

27,2022-01-18,2022-01-18,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Anirudh Tiwari,cointelegraph.com,Bitcoin miners’ resilience to geopolitics: A healthy sign for the network,Kazakhstan became a hub for Bitcoin mining after the Chinese government banned mining operations and cryptocurrency services in 2021.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-resilience-to-geopolitics-a-healthy-sign-for-the-network,"Considering that Bitcoin (BTC) is a blockchain network that uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, miners are a highly significant part of the market dynamics of the network and the community itself. On Jan. 5, it was revealed that Kazakhstan shut down its internet services due to unprecedented political unrest sparked by rising fuel prices in the country.
The protests in Kazakhstan began on Jan. 2 in the town of Zhanaozen to fight against the government doubling the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is widely used as car fuel in the country. This change in pricing came as a result of the gradual transition to the use of electronic trading of LPG in order to abolish the existing state subsidies for fuel and allow the market to discover the price of the asset.
However, protests in the region soon snowballed, gaining more momentum and continued despite the country’s government announcing that the prices of LPG would be brought down to a level lower than before the increase. Soon, this led to the country’s presiding cabinet resigning and the state-owned telecom company, Kazakhtelecom, shutting off the country’s internet services. Network data provider Netblocks reported that the normalized network connectivity fell down to 2%, with the government attempting to limit coverage on the escalating anti-government protests.
As a result, the Bitcoin network’s mining hash rate declined over 13% in the hours after the shutdown in the country from 205,000 petahash per second (PH/s) to 177,330 PH/s. Over the past year, the country grew to account for 18% of Bitcoin’s mining activity. A report from the Data Center Industry & Blockchain Association of Kazakhstan estimated that cryptocurrency mining would bring in $1.5 billion in revenue for the country in the next five years.
This is not the first time that Bitcoin mining in the region has received the spotlight. Despite being an energy-rich country, the Kazakh government announced last year that it planned to crack down on unregistered miners that were straining the country's energy supply after the mining migration from China.
Kazakhstan’s mining market share
The Central Asian country became a hub for Bitcoin mining after the Chinese government banned mining operations and cryptocurrency services in 2021. This led to the migration of mining companies like BIT Mining to relocate their operations from China to Kazakhstan. BIT Mining is one of the largest BTC mining companies in the world.
The mining company has indicated that it is unlikely to flee Kazakhstan to relocate to North America amid the political upheaval. The firm is closely monitoring and evaluating the situation in order to decide its next move with respect to mining.
However, countries like Spain have had their eyes on Kazakhstan’s mining market share. The Deputy for the Spanish Ciudadanos political party, María Muñoz, proposed to make the country a mining hotspot amid the current situation, stating in a tweet, “The protests in Kazakhstan have repercussions all around the world but also for Bitcoin. We propose that Spain positions itself as a safe destination for investments in cryptocurrencies to develop a flexible, efficient, and safe sector.”
Rob Chang, the CEO and director of Gryphon Digital Mining, a digital assets mining company, told Cointelegraph:
“Bitcoin mining will continue to grow and the need for viable locations will always be necessary. Countries with the foresight to make themselves Bitcoin-friendly will stand to do quite well as Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a legitimate alternative to fiat.”
As a result of China’s mining ban, the mining dynamics have shifted globally, with the United States leading the charge with over a third of the mining rate. Chang said that one benefit of this migration includes rehomed miners’ shift to a larger mix of carbon-free energy sources.
Additionally, some of the hash rates has gone to more transparent entities operating the mining machines, leading to increased security for the network and a higher level of public trust in Bitcoin miners.
Illia Polosukhin, the co-founder of the NEAR Protocol, a decentralized development platform, told Cointelegraph that in addition to China’s ban leading to a loss of investment, the loss of talent is another major factor:
“Chinese citizens living on the mainland and abroad are banned from working in the crypto sector, and that’s a big loss for the blockchain industry as a whole. It will stifle innovation and, eventually, leave Chinese citizens behind as more users begin to adopt Open Web technologies. It’s possible that more mining operations shifting to the United States could push the issue of blockchain and sustainability more fully into the public eye.”
Thriving amid geopolitical risks is rare for financial assets
The mining hash rate for the Bitcoin network recovered quickly from the drop to 168 million TH/s, according to data from YCharts. In fact, the network has taken a step forward with the hash rate hitting a new all-time high of 215 million TH/s on Jan. 13.
We’re officially building an open bitcoin mining system ✨ https://t.co/PaNc7gXS48 — jack⚡️ (@jack) January 13, 2022
This new all-time high was driven by the statement from ex-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, announcing the creation of an open Bitcoin mining system. Thomas Templeton, the general manager of hardware at Square, said, “We want to make mining more distributed and efficient in every way, from buying, to set up, to maintenance, to mining. We’re interested because mining goes far beyond creating new bitcoin. We see it as a long-term need for a future that is fully decentralized and permissionless.”
This new all-time high is evidence of how resilient the Bitcoin network and its community are to ensure that the network thrives at all costs.
However, it’s important to remember that such risks are not exclusive to Bitcoin. Chang said, “Geopolitical risk is a common issue for many industries, and Bitcoin mining is not immune. While there will be some that will take the risk and operate in these countries for the sake of lower costs, they do run the risk, such as those experienced in Kazakhstan or others such as the government deciding one day to take all of your machines. Operators will need to understand the risk/reward tradeoff.”

Polosukhin explained that no matter how distributed or decentralized a blockchain network is — Bitcoin or any other — it’s still intertwined with many legacy systems: energy grids, energy prices, regulation and the laws of nations. Bitcoin mining has either been banned or is facing uncertainty in many countries including Iran, Lebanon, Iceland and Sweden.
Being an energy-intensive PoW network, the Bitcoin network is expected to continue to thrive as long as miners are incentivized economically to continue to remain miners. A report from Fidelity Digital Assets, the crypto wing of Fidelity Investments, indicated that the Bitcoin cycle is far from over, and with the high financial incentives for miners, they are in it for the long haul.
While Bitcoin is in a price slump, currently trading around the $42,000 range with a market capitalization of $791 billion, the fact that miners — the core aspect of the network — have shown resilience to adverse situations over the 13-year history of the network reinforces the belief and trust the community puts on the flagship blockchain network."

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $38,761, according to Cointelegraph.
The price crash has so far wiped about $50 billion from the overall crypto market. The total crypto market capitalization has been on a slow decline since early November 2021 when it reached a peak of $3 trillion.
Without a single bombshell piece of news that many could blame the dump on, investors are wondering what caused the price action. Some pointed to macro indicators, with tech stocks on Nasdaq entering into “correction territory” and several interestrate hikes are expected to come in 2022.
But Bitcoin moves in mysterious ways. It could just as easily be the news that Bitcoin bull Raoul Pal has apparently sold all his Bitcoin and only has 1 BTC left…
The Rekt Capital Twitter account noted that the current pattern playing out “shares a few similarities with the price behavior of late September 2021.” At that time, Bitcoin tumbled several times from about $52,000 down to about $41,300 from September to October. It proceeded to rise up to $69,000 by early November.
The InvesetAnswers Twitter account, which has over 85,000 followers, suggested that bears “need #Bitcoin under $41,000 to pocket $132 million in gains.”

BTC is not the only crypto to plunge on Friday. Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and XRP have all experienced severe corrections between -6.3% and -10% in the past 12 hours.

Among the top 10 coins by market capitalization, ADA experienced the biggest overall losses as it dropped 10% to $1.21. Friday’s buggy launch of SundaeSwap did not appear to help matters.
Forbes contributor Billy Bambrough suggested in an article on Friday that investors have been rattled by recent announcements from the United States Federal Reserve that it would shrink its balance sheet and raise interest rates."

Bitcoin sank to $38,234—its lowest price level since mid-summer, according to Messari.
As of 7:27 a.m. EST, it is trading around $38,538, 43% lower than its record-high of $69,006, recorded on November 10.
“We expect BTC to find a bid around the $35,000 mark,” wrote Pankaj Balani, CEO and founder of crypto derivatives trading platform Delta Exchange, in a note to Forbes. “In the short term we can bounce to challenge the $45,000-$50,000 zone but the overall outlook remains bearish as liquidity remains tight.”
The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, has mirrored bitcoin’s losses, sliding 11.7% over the past 24 hours to $2,806.
Most market sectors, including DeFi and gaming, have suffered significant losses. Data from analytics tool Coinglass shows that over $700 million worth of crypto futures contracts across 190,000 trading positions have been liquidated over the past day.
Jan Wüstenfeld, on-chain analyst for crypto research firm Quantum Economics, cited “high macro uncertainty—most importantly high inflation, and in reaction to that, a more hawkish Federal Reserve Bank”—as the reason for the market’s negative performance.
As of late, cryptocurrencies have moved increasingly in sync with the broader financial markets. “Currently, the S&P 500 seems to dictate the direction of bitcoin and the overall crypto market, evident by correlations reaching new highs,” crypto analytics firm Arcane Research highlighted in a note issued on Tuesday. “Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation to the S&P 500 is currently at its highest since October 2020.”
Amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon start to raise interest rates, investors have been shedding their positions in riskier assets. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are on track for a third straight week of losses. The Nasdaq is down nearly 5% on the week.
Accordingly, bitcoin mining and other crypto proxy stocks have continued to slide. Most are down over 10% so far this year."

Here's what crypto investors should know,"Before investing in bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, you should first consider whether you can handle the volatility, experts say.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/bitcoin-is-down-below-40k-heres-what-crypto-investors-should-know.html,"The cryptocurrency market, along with other riskier assets, is taking a big hit.
Bitcoin is down 11% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Hitting its lowest level since August, the largest cryptocurrency by market value dropped below $40,000 on Friday, and is currently trading at around $38,378. Some analysts predict that it could fall even lower.
Along with it, ether, the second-largest, is down 14% in the same timeframe. It's currently trading around $2,779.
This comes as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffer losses as well. Cryptocurrencies and tech stocks have been falling at the same time this month, showing an increasing correlation between the two.
Additionally, there's concern over the potential for more cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S., as well as how the Federal Reserve potentially dialing back its monetary policy would impact the overall market. Globally, other regulators are focusing on cryptocurrency markets as well. On Thursday, for example, Russia's central bank proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies.
This dip isn't unusual for bitcoin; cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. As quickly as prices rise, they can tumble back down. Because of this, experts say it's important to consider if you can handle the ups and downs before investing in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.
""It's a very volatile asset class,"" Anjali Jariwala, certified financial planner, certified public accountant and founder of Fit Advisors, previously told CNBC Make It. ""You have to be comfortable with the swings and you have to be comfortable also losing your money.""
Each investor's risk tolerance will vary. It's important to understand how much you can personally tolerate.
For some people, the volatility ""may be OK, that may coincide with your appetite for risk and your own risk tolerance and investment time horizon,"" Douglas Boneparth, certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth, previously told CNBC Make It. ""But, you still got to live with it.""
Other investors may prefer something more stable.
Regardless of your tolerance level, financial experts warn that this volatility makes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a riskier investment than something like a low-cost index fund, which allows investors to buy a collection of stocks at once, rather than bet on a single asset.
If you decide to invest anyway, ""you have to make sure that it's money that you can really afford to lose,"" Jariwala said.
Boneparth agrees: ""Be very careful about how much you allocate and understanding what you can tolerate, because if 80% of your net worth is tied to bitcoin, and it goes down 30%, that's rough.""
Depending on what you can afford, a smaller allocation in bitcoin can hedge any potential downturns in the market.

The coin fell as much as 8.7% and over 40% from its record-high in November 2021. Here are 5 investment tips to face Bitcoin's rough week.
1. Invest for the long haul
The volatility of Bitcoin makes its prices rise and fall in dramatic fashion from day to day, urging novice traders to sell when prices are low. For example, those who bought BTCUSD in late 2017 and sold before October 2020 would have suffered a loss.
When investing in cryptocurrencies, those who practice patience and play the long game will come out on top when it's all said and done. Digital wallets aren't going anywhere, anytime soon, so leave your money in the market as long as possible to get the biggest returns.
2. Don't put all your eggs in one basket
It's important to diversify your crypto portfolio as much as possible like you would with stocks and shares. The top coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Tether, and Solana.
Spreading your money among different cryptocurrencias means you limit the risk of over-exposure if one digital currency plummets in value. Make sure to do your research before you purchase a new cryptocurrency.
3. Automate purchase process
Most cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to set up recurring buys as they would with stocks and shares. Essentially, an automated purchase process is when investors tell the platform to buy a certain amount of a cryptocurrency each month.
Even though investors will get less of the currency when prices are high, they'll make up for it by getting more when prices are low. Automating this process takes the stress out of trying to time the market, which is something that even the best professionals struggle with.
4. How to manage risk with Bitcoin
Avoid crypto tips from people who promise you will get rich quickly with little investment. Setting limits on investments is the best way to avoid losing money you don't have.
Cryptocurrency trading is a high-risk venture where traders lose more often than not. A good mentality to have is that crypto-trading is as volatile as gambling, you never really know if you'll win or lose, so never spend more money than what you can afford to go without.
5. Create a Crypto strategy
Crypto scams are a dime a dozen nowadays, growing to 7,118 in the first nine months of 2021 - up 30% on the entirety of 2020 - with the average loss at nearly $28,000 per victim. Make sure to always do your research on new coins you invest in, asking yourself critical questions to see if the investment is too good to be true.
Ask yourself if the coin has any links with the industry, if it solves a problem, and how many active users it has. Some new cryptocoins promise earnings upwards of what the industry leaders provide, so avoid those who make promises they can't keep."

Cryptocurrencies across the board continued to slide in value, with indexes a sea of red still on Sunday.
The price of Bitcoin was, however, up 1.8 per cent from the year's low of $34,000 (€29,970). It’s also plummeted over 40 per cent since its historic high in November when its value reached $68,992 (€60,895.79).
At midday CET on Sunday, it was still down over 17 per cent week-on-week but had recovered 1 per cent to $35,678.42 (€31,449.28), according to coinmarketgap.com.
Ether, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, also dropped 8.4 per cent to $2,352.72 (€2,073.84) on Saturday, losing $189.64 (€167.16) from its previous close.
At 12 pm CET on Sunday, it had rallied around 2 per cent to $2,491.81 (€2,196.44) but was still down 25 per cent week-on-week.
The total market cap fell over 11 per cent on Friday to $1.9 trillion (€1.6 trillion), down from an all-time high of $3.1 trillion (€2.7 trillion) in November, according to data from CoinGecko.
What happened this week to cause a crypto crash?
The losses across the crypto market mirrored similar losses in the traditional stock market, with the Nasdaq 100 shedding around 15 per cent on Friday as well. It was the worst week for the tech-heavy Nasdaq since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with over $60 billion (€53 billion) in losses.
In particular, the prospect of a rate hike by the US Federal Reserve is pushing investors away from riskier assets, including cryptocurrency.
In addition, regulators are increasingly concerned about the place of cryptocurrencies in the economy with concerns there will be a further crackdown on digital currency.
The Spanish market regulator strongly regulated advertising for trading platforms this week, and similar measures are being studied elsewhere in Europe, particularly in the UK.
Elsewhere, the Russian Central Bank on Thursday proposed a ban on mining and use of cryptocurrencies in the country, arguing it posed a threat to Russia’s “financial stability and monetary policy sovereignty”."

The price of the digital coin slipped 9 per cent in afternoon trading in Europe to $33,307, its lowest point since mid-July. Although it remains the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value, Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since peaking at just under $69,000 last year.
The broader digital asset market has also come under intense selling pressure, with an FT Wilshire index tracking the top five digital coins excluding Bitcoin down 27 per cent in 2022.
The sharp falls across crypto markets have ricocheted into the US stock market. A basket of cryptocurrency-related shares collated by Goldman Sachs has shed around a third of its value in 2022. Coinbase, the US-listed crypto exchange, dropped 13 per cent on Monday, while MicroStrategy, a software company that heavily invests in bitcoin, fell by a similar margin.
“This looks like a crash for now,” said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank in a note on Monday.
The sell-off has coincided with a wider shift by investors out of speculative assets as they prepare for central banks around the world to rein in their stimulus programmes. Expectations for higher interest rates make riskier investments less desirable since it increases the returns investors can earn from holding top-quality securities like US government bonds.
“It’s very much an environment where one should be short for at least another month . . . anything that is speculative and hypey, and long companies that benefit from rate hikes”, said Tancredi Cordero, founder of Kuros Associates. Shorting refers to betting against shares in a company, while ‘going long’ is the opposite.
“The funny thing about crypto and Bitcoin”, said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX group, “is that they’re assets that were born out of a rejection of the existing system, and yet they’ve benefited so greatly from that system and the monetary policy incentives that have driven an unprecedented flow into risk assets”.
The allure of cryptocurrencies has been further damaged by moves from regulatory bodies around the world to tighten rules on how digital assets and traded and advertised.
Russia’s central bank last week proposed banning all cryptocurrency operations in the country, saying that like other “financial pyramids”, the value of digital coins is “largely supported by demand from new entrants to the market”.
The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority said last Wednesday that it hopes to clamp down on misleading crypto adverts, following moves to boost consumer protections in Spain, Singapore and Italy.
Shares in MicroStrategy, led by well-known crypto bull Michael Saylor, had tumbled by more than 17 per cent on Friday after the US Securities and Exchange Commission objected to the group’s exclusion of fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin from its adjusted accounting measures."

The prices of bitcoin and ether fell to six-month lows Monday morning, continuing a sell-off of major cryptocurrencies that has dashed more than $1 trillion in value from the market since November.

Key Facts
The price of bitcoin, which makes up nearly 40% of the crypto market and is the most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to around $33,500 Monday morning, down more than 6% from 24 hours before. Ether, the second most valuable cryptocurrency and around 16% of the overall market, fell more than 11% to around $2,200. Both cryptocurrencies are at their lowest points since July last year and have shed around half their value since reaching record-breaking highs in November. Other major tokens—including XRP, cardano, solana and Binance’s BNB—have experienced similarly steep drops over the last 24 hours, falling between roughly 8% and 12%. The losses continue a days-long rout for major tokens like bitcoin (down 23% over the last week), ether (35%), Binance’s BNB (32%), cardano (31%) and solana (45%).
Key Background
The Federal Reserve triggered a crypto sell-off when it indicated it may combat inflation by moving faster to remove pandemic-era stimulus and raising interest rates. The market has been in broad decline since reaching record highs of more than $3 trillion in November and more than $1 trillion has been wiped off it in the weeks since. It is now worth some $1.59 trillion, according to CoinGecko.

42,2022-01-24,2022-01-24,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Jordan Weissmann,slate.com,Bitcoin Is Just a Crappy Tech Stock Now,"As soon as the market gets less frothy, people notice that the cryptocurrency is useless.",https://slate.com/business/2022/01/bitcoin-crash-crappy-tech-stock.html,"Originally, Bitcoin was supposed to be a currency.
Then, it was supposed to be a hedge against inflation, a sort of digital gold.
But as the great crypto market crash of the last three months has begun to unfold, it’s started to look like something much more mundane: a crappy tech stock.
Digital currencies, on the whole, have been in free fall lately. Despite recovering ever-so-slightly on Monday, Bitcoin has lost about 45 percent of its value since November, while other crypto assets, such as Ether, have shed even more. During this collapse, the wider crypto market has lost more than $1.3 trillion of value—roughly the worth of all outstanding federal student debt.

This clattering, monthslong crash is a reminder of why Bitcoin has never really worked well as a regular currency despite the vast resources that have been spent trying to make it catch on. Reliable currencies tend to have relatively stable values—it’s considered a big deal if the U.S. dollar moves up or down by 10 percent. Bitcoin, in contrast, can move that much in a day, thanks to the massive amount of speculative trading around it, which makes it a poor medium of exchange or store of value. Investors take this volatility for granted now. “Long downturns like this are normal with crypto,” the CEO of a crypto tech company that works with asset managers told CNBC. “Folks should know that going in.” That might be sound advice, but it makes a mockery of the idea that crypto will ever really be capable of replacing dollars or euros.

But this crash hasn’t just undercut the case that Bitcoin might be a viable currency (which has seemed pretty unlikely for a while). It’s also shattering one of the big arguments in favor of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an investment asset class. Because the supply of Bitcoin is technically capped and there’s no central bank to print more, it has long been hyped as a safe place where investors could put their money if they were worried about inflation—a form of gold without the inconvenience and cost of storing a load of shiny metal. That’s traditionally been a big part of its appeal to hard-money libertarians who distrust the Federal Reserve.
The theory that Bitcoin would act like an inflation hedge seemed plausible for much of 2021, when consumer prices picked up and crypto values skyrocketed. But now? Not so much, since Bitcoin and its cousins are in retreat even though inflation is still very much with us. “You’d think with the inflation we’re seeing, you’d see the opposite,” Bob Fitzsimmons, the executive vice president for fixed income, commodities, and stock lending at Wedbush Securities, told the Washington Post recently. “That’s been one of the selling points for Bitcoin.” In contrast, the price of actual gold, the oldest inflation hedge of all, has stayed relatively stable in recent months, and is up a bit over the last 60 days.

Instead of a currency or an inflation hedge, Bitcoin seems to be acting like something else: a tech stock. Over time, its performance has become increasingly correlated with the Nasdaq index. (Its correlation with gold is practically nil.)

Investors, in short, have been betting on Bitcoin as a gamble on tech froth, of which there’s been a lot in recent years. But lately, traders have been dumping stocks and other risky assets in anticipation of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates soon to try and control inflation. As a result, they’re dumping crypto too. (It doesn’t help matters that Russia’s central bank has announced plans to ban crypto, much as China already has.) There’s some dramatic irony here: Again, Bitcoin’s ideological roots lay partly in the desire to create a form of private money totally free from central bank meddling. But ultimately, like every other asset, its value is swinging to Jerome Powell’s tune. You can’t ever really escape the influence of the Fed.

All of this also raises an important question about Bitcoin: What, exactly, is it supposed to be good for? Nobody really needs another way to bet on tech stocks. You can … just bet on tech stocks for that. Unlike the Ethereum network, meanwhile, Bitcoin isn’t widely thought of as a useful platform for advanced financial services. (Update, Jan. 25, 2022, at 1:37 p.m.: Some hope that a recent network upgrade designed to make executing so-called smart contracts in Bitcoin will change that, but it’s unclear how much impact the update will have.) One potential answer is crime—crypto is the preferred payment method for hackers who perpetrate ransomware attacks—but that doesn’t exactly bode well for Bitcoin’s long-term future. So if it isn’t a currency, isn’t a gold substitute, and isn’t even a very good way to diversify your portfolio, what exactly is its purpose? As far as I can tell, other than buying some drugs online, the answer is absolutely nothing."

Bitcoin bounced into positive territory Monday after initially continuing its slide from last week. On Monday, bitcoin fell to $32,982.11, its lowest point since July, according to Coin Metrics, but the largest cryptocurrency by market cap was up 5.6% in afternoon trading, to $37,183.25, as broader equities reversed course and ended the day higher. Earlier in the session, the Dow fell as much as 1,115 points and the S&P 500 briefly fell into correction territory. Ether plunged to as low as $2,176.41, its lowest since July, according to Coin Metrics. It last rose 1.1% to $2,444.85. Bitcoin and ether are about 45% and 49% off their respective all-time highs. Cryptocurrencies have been moving in tandem with stocks, which have continued to fall since the beginning of the year and just came off of their worst week since March 2020. Investors have been selling risk assets like technology stocks, as they prepare for tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. ""It's possible that macroeconomic concerns, such as the Fed's response to inflation rates, have facilitated more de-risking activity in general,"" said Juthica Chou, head of OTC options trading at Kraken. ""The recent price drop, coupled with high volatility, could be leading to further selling as participants look to reduce risk.""

Investors also are assessing the impact of further regulation on the cryptocurrency market. Last week, Russia's central bank proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies. Given current market sentiment, bitcoin is likely to test the $30,000-$32,000 range, according to Vijay Ayyar, Luno's vice president of corporate development and international expansion. If the cryptocurrency holds above $30,000 for as long as one week, there could be a base formed at those levels before the market moves higher, he said. However, it could be some time for the market to turn bullish given the lack of confidence across the spectrum, he added. Several other analysts have said they see $30,000 as the next level of support for the cryptocurrency to test. However, analyst John Roque of 22V Research said bitcoin could fall even further. He also has been using $30,000 as a target but noted the median historical bear market for bitcoin is down 78%."

Bitcoin price crash explained and what experts say about future of cryptocurrency,Rising inflation and the global spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have affected both crypto and the stock market,https://inews.co.uk/light-relief/cryptocurrency/crypto-recover-will-bitcoin-price-crash-cryptocurrency-prices-down-explained-1419425,"The cryptocurrency market crashed further on Monday, with Bitcoin falling below $33,500.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has lost almost a quarter of its value over the last four days, and other coins have suffered similar losses.
Ethereum has dipped below $2,200 after losing more than 12 per cent of its value in the last 24 hours.
Cardano is now below $1, XRP has dropped below $0.60 and Shiba Inu has fallen to $0.00019.
Why is cryptocurrency crashing?
Cryptocurrency’s downturn is due to a combination of factors.
Rising inflation and the global spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have affected both crypto and the stock market.
The Russian central bank has proposed a ban on cryptocurrency and crypto exchanges, and the UK is clamping down on advertising around cryptoassets.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest – but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims.
“We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.”
David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, said: “One of the bullish drivers for crypto over the last two years has been the surplus of pandemic-related fiscal and monetary stimulus globally, and much of that is coming to an end.”
Will it recover?
Many experts are predicting crypto’s downturn to continue in the short term.
However, there is still room for positivity when looking longer term.
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, told Bloomberg: “We don’t think it is a bad thing if market volatility takes some of the air out of the more speculative corners of the market.”
Guido Buehler, chief executive of Swiss digital asset bank Seba, has suggested a new record high could be possible in 2022.
“Our internal valuation models indicate a price right now between $50,000 and $75,000,” he told Forbes.
“I’m quite confident we’re going to see that level. The question is always timing.”
What are the risks around cryptocurrency?
People invest at their own risk and cryptocurrencies are not regulated by British financial authorities.
All crypto investments are risky, but meme coins like Shiba Inu are particularly volatile, and you should be prepared to lose everything you invest.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned in January: “Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors’ money.
“If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money.”
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown previously explained the risks to i.
She said: “On top of being extremely volatile, most cryptocurrencies are unregulated, which not only adds another layer of uncertainty but also means that investors have little or no protection against fraud.”"
45,2022-01-27,2022-01-27,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Marca English,www.marca.com,Nayib Bukele Bitcoin: Why is El Salvador's president biding the country's economy on Bitcoin?,"El Salvador purchased 410 bitcoin worth $15 million as the cryptocurrency's price plunged.
""El Salvador just bought 410 #bitcoin for only 15 million dollars,"" the c",https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/2022/01/28/61f31d7146163f66768b4611.html,"El Salvador purchased 410 bitcoin worth $15 million as the cryptocurrency's price plunged.
""El Salvador just bought 410 #bitcoin for only 15 million dollars,"" the country's president Nayib Bukele tweeted on Friday.
Bukele, one of the biggest promoters of cryptocurrencies, has turned the Central American country, with an average GDP per capita of less than $4,000, into one of the biggest drivers of cryptocurrencies.
In June 2021, Bukele promoted a legislative vote to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. Besides him, many lawmakers claimed that Bitcoin acceptance could bring unbanked citizens into the economy and facilitate cross-border payments. Critics, however, called the move irresponsible.
El Salvador's president referred to the sale of cryptocurrencies, saying, ""Some guys are selling very cheaply.""
Bukele's commitment to Bitcoin has sown distrust among citizens and in global financial markets.
However, Bitcoin has plummeted recently, triggering a sharp pullback from investors, which has hit the most valuable parts of the stock market, such as technology stocks.
How does bitcoin impact El Salvador's economy?
Bitcoin has fallen 20% in the past week and has lost nearly 28% this month. It has fallen nearly 50% from its all-time high of around $69,000 in November, putting it firmly in bear market territory.
According to Bloomberg, El Salvador holds at least 1,801 bitcoins worth about $66 million as of Jan. 25, or 2% of the country's listed 2020 reserves. (At Bitcoin's all-time high in November, those coins would have been worth $124 million.)
The Federal Reserve intends to reduce the support it provided to the economy during the pandemic and will raise interest rates this year as it struggles with a rapid rise in consumer inflation and wages.
To service its debt, El Salvador needs money. Its finances depend on international investors being willing to buy more national debt, which currently represents about 84% of its GDP (dangerous territory for a small, slow-growing economy).
The Bukele's government are now attempting to negotiate a loan from the IMF."

But die-hard enthusiasts believe prices will keep soaring in a world where traditional notions of value don’t apply.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/business/crypto-price-bubble.html,"Despite their volatile and occasionally inscrutable nature, cryptocurrencies are becoming more widely traded, used and held — El Salvador recently started accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, the Federal Reserve is studying whether to issue its own digital coin, and wealth managers are encouraging clients to explore crypto assets.
So how does a new investor make sense of crypto and its constantly changing landscape?
The short answer: It’s impossible.
There are so few reliable measures of value that it’s hard to tell whether the excitement around a particular cryptocurrency is justified — or a bubble about to burst. Traditional financial analysis doesn’t apply here. A stock analyst, for instance, determines whether a company’s shares are expensive or cheap by assessing its business model, future prospects and leadership. But few, if any, of those metrics translate to cryptocurrency valuation. Belief alone can drive value.
It’s hard to even know what counts as a “cryptocurrency.” Bitcoin and Ether are widely regarded as currencies because, like the dollar or the pound, they are used to buy and sell many goods and services. Another 11,000 or more digital coins and tokens also exist, many of them vying to gain enough acceptance to become the next Bitcoin or Ether.
(Coins operate on their own digital backbones, called blockchains. Tokens rely on other blockchains to get around in cyberspace. Coins, tokens and other assets are stored in wallets, which are comparable to online bank accounts except that their holdings are visible to all.)
By standard measures of value, the prices of Bitcoin and Ether are understandable. They are priced highly — with market capitalizations on Wednesday of nearly $690 billion and $290 billion — because they are well established and liquid, with broad user bases. Bitcoin is held in nearly nine million wallets, according to Chainalysis, a data provider."

After briefly appearing to decouple from risk-sensitive stocks, Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD) and its crypto cohorts ended Wednesday's whipsaw session in the red, along with Wall Street. The reversal signaled the correlation with equities was not likely to end anytime soon, especially with the Fed poised to hike interest rates as early as March.
The leading crypto units were down by at least 3% in early dealings, with Bitcoin changing hands below $37,000 — not far from the week's spike low around $33,250. Investors are struggling to reprice digital coins in the face of fiscal and monetary policy that will be ""less supportive of growth this year,"" as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted on Wednesday.
Bitcoin is inching closer to the week's lows after a brief rally.
""Crypto prices the past few months, along with growth stocks, bear the brunt of the market bleeding,"" CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. He cited the uncertainty surrounding the Fed's next moves as weighing on the sector.
The coming monetary tightening cycle is scrambling the outlook for crypto assets that benefit from loose monetary policy and lavish federal government spending. The market's pivot to risk aversion will continue to drive crypto prices in the near-term, according to Mikkel Morch, executive director & risk management of crypto asset hedge fund ARK36.
Smaller cryptocurrencies that fuel layer-1 smart contract blockchains such as Solana (SOL1-USD), Terra (LUNA1-USD), Polkadot (DOT-USD) and Avalanche (AVAX-USD) were all down by at least 5%, normal for this class of assets as they sit higher up on a typical investor’s risk curve.
“While Powell did indeed sound dovish at the beginning of the press conference, it seems that he failed to offer enough reassurance to really turn the tide of the bearish sentiment that has gripped the markets since last week,” Morch told Yahoo Finance.
Story continues
Crypto derivatives were sending a marginally bullish signal, with the 8-hour funding rate staying positive, according to derivatives platform, Coinglass. That means a slim majority of speculators expect a bullish short-term outcome.
Yet Bitcoin's collapse since hitting a record high in November above $68,000 tells the real story. Meanwhile, a new Bitcoin futures-based exchange traded funds (ETFs), ProShares' BITO, has plunged by 46% since its peak on November 9. It changed hands around $23 per share in early Thursday dealings.
Brett Harrison, president of the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX.US — which closed a $400 million capital raise this week — told Yahoo Finance that crypto volatility is ""par for the course."" But he cited that a steady flow of venture capital funding and talent can act as a leading indicator for the sector's growth dynamic, which remains intact.
""As long as there's a continued intellectual migration from finance and computer jobs into crypto jobs, and vc money pouring in, people will want to build,"" Harrison said. ""They'll build value, and that will make it back to the markets eventually.""

Bitcoin hodler metric points to ‘depressed’ BTC price,"Bitcoin may be seeing ""depressed"" moves on BTC as hodlers knuckle down for the long haul.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-blow-off-top-bitcoin-hodler-metric-points-to-depressed-btc-price,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors are famous for their ability to “hodl” through price dips, but new data sheds light on how long they may be prepared to continue.
In a tweet on Jan. 16, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode noted that holder behavior currently mimics how Bitcoin behaves during the least extreme part of its price cycles.
Reserve Risk: Bitcoin price ‘depressed,’ hodlers hodl on
Referring to its Reserve Risk (R-Risk) metric, Glassnode argued that current buying and selling trends are not those of a macro top or bottom.
“Low values of R-Risk are characteristic of mid-bear to mid-bull cycles, where prices are depressed, but HODLing dominates onchain,” it explained.
R-Risk looks at the number of days holders choose not to sell versus current price action, resulting, among other things, in an indication of market mindset at a given price point.
Currently, R-Risk is trending downward and is flirting with its “depressed” zone.

In an explanatory article originally accompanying the metric, Glassnode additionally said that such moves take a longer rather than shorter time to resolve, again suggesting that an event such as this halving cycle’s blow-off top may be a long way off.
“The Reserve Risk oscillator can be seen to oscillate in line with the macro bull/bear market cycles. It has well defined peaks in line with blow-off tops, and lengthy periods of relative undervaluation during bear market bottoms and into early bull markets,” it summarizes.
Miners cool “massive” accumulation trend
The data conforms to the overall impression of long-term BTC hodlers doubling down on their conviction in the face of an unexpected downtrend.

Depending on the source, this corrective period has in fact lasted throughout 2021, and as Cointelegraph reported, there is no sign of capitulation among old hands.
Data from fellow analytics firm CryptoQuant, meanwhile, shows that miners, who have also been “massively” accumulating in recent months, began keeping their reserves more constant in January. Bitcoin sitting at their production cost, reducing profitability, could be a likely cause."

This column was originally published in November 2021.
Despite Bitcoin launching way back in 2009, it’s only until recently that you can’t turn on the news or browse the web without coming across some mention of cryptocurrency.
I got so many questions from my readers and national radio show listeners that I wrote an e-book about crypto to help. I demystify digital currency, mining, and how to get started trading. Tap or click here to get your copy on Amazon.
Sadly, I also hear from people that got fooled by one crypto scam or another. Where there is money, criminals are waiting. Tap or click for five clever crypto scams making the rounds right now and steps to stay safe.
Before we get started, know this is not financial advice. The crypto world is volatile, and you should never risk money you aren’t comfortable losing. Now, let’s take a look at some of the most common lingo:
CRYPTO COLLAPSE?: Why is crypto down so much? Uncertainty in traditional markets and Fed concerns, experts say
STOCK MARKET QUESTIONS: Worried about the stock market? Ask yourself these 3 questions to protect your finances.
Blockchain
Every cryptocurrency transaction is processed, verified, and recorded on a virtual ledger known as a blockchain. When someone buys or sells using cryptocurrency, another entry is made on this virtual ledger.
Think of the blockchain as a series of boxcars from a train. When a cryptocurrency transaction is made, another boxcar gets added to the train.
The blockchain is decentralized. This means it’s not stored on one machine or even across one network. Instead, the blockchain exists on computers all over the world that are accessible because of the internet.
People and companies help verify each transaction that gets added to the blockchain using their own computer’s processing power on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is timestamped, individually encrypted, and cannot be reversed or changed. Yes, you read that right – crypto transactions cannot be reversed.
Would you rather listen than read? Tap or click for an episode of my podcast, Kim Komando Explains, about everything crypto. You'll also hear first-hand from a crypto miner too.
Fiat
I know what you’re thinking: “I thought a Fiat was a car.” Not in crypto-land. Fiat money is government-issued currency. If you’re in the United States, that means the U.S. dollar.
Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is virtual money.
Cryptocurrencies aren’t backed by governments or any other standard used with traditional currency. Each “token” represents the amount you own.
How much each token is worth varies based on the current market value. One day it's up; the next day down. With cryptocurrency, the price fluctuations can happen much faster and are more extreme – both positive and negative. A good resource to check the current prices is CoinMarketCap.
Cryptocurrency is the hot, new trend for some investors It's a hot new buzzword for investors, but is cryptocurrency here to stay? Staff video, USA TODAY
Altcoin
Here’s an easy one to remember. An altcoin is any digital currency that’s not Bitcoin. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, with new ones being added all the time.
At the time of this writing, these are the five currencies with the highest market caps. (That is the total market value of the circulating supply.) Since crypto moves so fast, this list may have already changed by the time you’re reading.
• Bitcoin
• Ethereum
• Binance Coin
• Tether
• Solana
Exchange
To buy cryptocurrency, you need to start with an exchange. Think of an exchange like a crypto middleman. It’s an online service that allows you to exchange your fiat for crypto or change crypto into fiat.
If you're familiar with traditional investing, a crypto exchange functions as a brokerage. You can deposit money through a bank transfer, by wire, through a debit card, and other standard deposit methods. You can expect to pay fees for most transactions.
You can also buy crypto through apps you already might be using, like Venmo, Robinhood, or Cash App.

Wallet
In basic terms, a cryptocurrency wallet is an app or physical storage device that allows you to store and retrieve your digital currency. Wallets can hold multiple cryptocurrencies, so you’re not limited to just Bitcoin, for example.
Whether you use an app or a physical wallet, it’s important to note that the currency itself isn’t stored there. Rather, wallets store the location of your currency on the blockchain.
Wallets are split into two main categories: Hot and cold. A hot wallet is, by definition, connected to the internet. The most secure way to store your cryptocurrency is with a cold wallet – one that isn’t connected to the internet.
Physical wallets come in different types but are usually specially designed USB drives that directly store your cryptocurrency for later use. Physical wallets provide you the most protection from hackers.
Two popular cold wallets are the Ledger Nano X and Trezor Model One. Of the two, I prefer the Ledger Nano X because it supports 23 different types of cryptocurrencies and has additional features.
Privacy tip: What browser you use matters if you’re concerned about privacy. I ranked them for you here. Did your pick make the list?
Mining
You have probably heard this term associated with Bitcoin, which is created by mining. Computers mine coins by solving complex math problems. The more powerful the computer, the faster it can “think.”
Now, if your computer is the fastest one to solve the problem, bingo – you win one unit of whatever cryptocurrency you’re mining.
While there are a few cryptocurrencies out there with an infinite supply, most have a limit. For Bitcoin, that limit is 21 million. The last coin will be mined in 2140 or sooner.
DeFi
Here’s another simple one. DeFi is a shortened version of decentralized finance. This term refers to financial transactions that happen without a “middleman,” like the government, a bank, or another financial institution.
Still, getting your arms around traditional online banking? It's perfectly safe if you follow a few rules of thumb. Tap or click for banking security 101.
NFT
You’ve heard of them: Nonfungible tokens. That’s a fancy way of saying, “This digital item is one of a kind and irreplaceable.” It applies to anything you can imagine, from online artwork to songs, viral videos, articles, text logos, and GIFs.
Some people collect vintage cars, wines, famous art and baseball cards. Now, any digital item also can be turned into a collectible. They also act as status symbols online. Check Jimmy Fallon’s Twitter profile picture for an example.
The only way to buy an NFT is by using cryptocurrency. You can buy an NFT through an auction platform, secondary marketplace, or by participating in a mint. What’s that, you ask?
Mint or minting
Minting is how a file, such as a JPEG or GIF, is recorded to a blockchain. After an NFT is minted, it can be sold or traded. If you are participating in a mint, that means you are the first person to buy that work from its creator. You can hold it, sell it, or trade it.
During the minting process, the creator specifies the royalties they receive from future sales. This acts as commission if the work changes hands in the future and is a big draw for artists looking to go digital. If you sell an NFT on a secondary marketplace, it likely gets a cut of the sale too.
HODL
Here's a term you might see on social media. HODL stands for ""hold on for dear life."" Some say it originated as a typo of the word ""hold"" on a Bitcoin forum way back, but now it's everyday slang.
The idea behind it is simple: If you believe a project or currency will gain more value, just “hodl” even through dips in the market.

51,2022-01-28,2022-01-28,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,William Suberg,cointelegraph.com,‘Bull or bear market?’ Bitcoin losses from panic selling mount in 2022,"Bitcoin is losing panic sellers money again this month, BTC on-chain data shows.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bull-or-bear-market-bitcoin-losses-from-panic-selling-mount-in-2022,"Bitcoin (BTC) sellers’ losses are mounting as the BTC price downturn shows that some investors are panicking at current prices.
Data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode and trading suite Decentrader shows that in January, more and more BTC entities have been selling coins for less than they purchased them.
On-chain loss selling now “consistent”
While no one wants to sell an asset without profit, Bitcoin downtrends tend to see a certain cohort of market participants do so anyway — for fear of greater losses if they stay put.
This panic selling is often derided by long-term investors, who argue that stronger, more liquid players will scoop up the supply to the detriment of those who sold.
Analyzing the spent profit output ratio (SOPR) metric, Decentrader analyst Philip Swift revealed that while selling overall remains relatively low, panic has set in this year.
“SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) has had a consistent patch of on-chain loss selling recently, he summarized to Twitter followers this week.
SOPR takes the aggregate “price bought versus price sold"" data for BTC in a given period to produce an overall impression of whether sellers are in profit or at a loss.
As noted by its creator, Renato Shirakashi, the psychology of selling at a loss means that only those in panic mode are likely to do so, and by extension, the shallower selling this month could be cause for relief.
“It’s interesting to note that the selling at a loss the past few months has been much more shallow vs. 2018/19 bear market, but much deeper than we saw in either bull run period,” Swift nonetheless added.
“Is this a bull or bear market rn?”

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s price activity has surprised with its 50% retracement since November, this being somewhat uncharacteristic of what should be the most bullish part of its halving cycle.
Zooming out, the whole of 2021 arguably looks like a consolidation zone after rapid gains a year ago.
Big players dominate the transactions
Meanwhile, should selling be from low-volume retail investors, this would chime with other data covering on-chain transactions.
Related: Derivatives data suggests that Bitcoin’s $39K bounce was a mere blip
As Glassnode confirmed this week, the majority of transactions now involve significant sums of $1 million or more. This, the firm concluded, points to institutions, not retail, as the driving on-chain force.
“Bitcoin transfer volumes continue to be dominated by institutional size flows, with more than 65% of all transactions being larger than $1M in value,” a tweet read.
“The uptrend in institutional dominance in onchain volumes started around Oct 2020 when prices were around $10k to $11k.”

52,2022-01-28,2022-01-28,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Prashant Jha,cointelegraph.com,Belgian MP becomes first European politician to accept salary in Bitcoin,"Not just politicians, some of the biggest names in the sports have also come forward to accept Bitcoin salaries",https://cointelegraph.com/news/belgian-mp-becomes-first-european-politician-to-accept-salary-in-bitcoin,"Bitcoin (BTC) craze among lawmakers has reached the Belgian parliament now, as Brussels member of parliament Christophe De Beukelaer became the first European politician to convert his salary to Bitcoin.
The Brussels MP’s monthly salary of EUR 5,500 ($6,140.75) will be converted to Bitcoin using the Bit4You crypto trading platform, reported Bruzz. Beukelaer, who represents Humanist Democratic Centre (CDH) party, hopes his move would inspire other politicians in the region to show a similar interest in the nascent tech.
Beukelaer cited the example of New York City Mayor Eric Adams and how American politicians are working to make their native states or cities Bitcoin hubs. He said:
“New York City Mayor Eric Adams has spent three months collecting his Bitcoin salary to make New York the Bitcoin hub. I think it is not too late for Brussels and Belgium to play a leading role in the cryptocurrency industry.""
Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez is another popular lawmaker who is known for his BTC advocacy. He has been quite vocal about making the city a Bitcoin hub and apart from getting his own salary in Bitcoin, he has been working on policies to make the same option available for the city employees.

Today's price of Bitcoin is 50% below its November high. From $69,000 in November, Bitcoin crushed its price value to $32,951 last week.
Diverse cryptocurrencies have lost considerable value. For example, Ethereum, common crypto used by NFT collectors is at its lowest point since July.
Ethreum dropped almost $1,000 in value in January.
Main reasons
The Biden administration is trying to develop a strategy to regulate cryptos due to national security challenges posed by Bitcoin.
The Federal Government actions began a massive campaign for traders to sell their Bitcoin holdings.
The Bitcoin prices are also affected by US Federal Reserve's policy changes.
Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve Chair, said the Federal Open Market Committee will increase the double monthly rate, reducing asset purchases.
The Federal Reserve took those measures to control inflation and the negative impact on the prices of Bitcoin.

Leading investment bank JPMorgan has changed its view on the estimate of bitcoin’s price on a long-term basis. The institution had estimated a long-term price of $146K back in November when bitcoin was over $60K. One of the most important reasons for this change has to do with the increased volatility the asset has faced in recent times.
JPMorgan Changes Long-Term Bitcoin Price Estimate
JPMorgan, one of the biggest financial institutions in the world, has drastically changed its opinion on the price that bitcoin will reach long term. While JPMorgan was bullish last year, when it estimated this number at almost $150K, it has lowered its estimations due to the situation the market is experiencing this year.
The new $38K price, about one-fourth of the previously calculated number, was estimated in a different context concerning gold and bitcoin and the volatility of the market. On this, JPMorgan stated in a note:
Our previous projection that the bitcoin to gold volatility ratio will fall to around 2x later this year seems unrealistic. Our fair value for bitcoin based on a volatility ratio of bitcoin to gold of around 4x would be 1/4th of $150,000, or $38,000.
Increased Volatility Hurts Institutional Adoption
Another factor that JPMorgan examined is the volatility bitcoin and the crypto market at large have been experiencing. This, according to the bank, makes it difficult for institutions to put their bets on bitcoin for reasons other than being a speculative asset.
The note concluded:
The biggest challenge for bitcoin going forward is its volatility and the boom and bust cycles that hinder further institutional adoption.
The recent slump in cryptocurrency prices was attributed to several factors, and some considered the recent announcements by the Federal Reserve would affect the crypto markets, which have exhibited a correlation with other markets like the S&P500. One of these people was Arthur Hayes, who in a recent digest called “Circo Loco,” recommended a “wait and see” approach for investors wanting to get into the cryptocurrency market.
Also, a report from Huobi titled “Taper Landed” issued in December, explained that the upcoming tapering would affect the growth of the cryptocurrency market. JPMorgan believes the market could go down even further, as it also found no signs of capitulation in the recent market movements.

How are transaction fees determined?
Transaction costs are calculated based on the transaction's data volume and network congestion.
As a block can only hold 4 MB of data, the number of transactions that can be executed in one block is limited. Therefore, more block data is required for a larger transaction. As a result, more significant transactions are usually charged on a per-byte basis.
When you use a BTC wallet to send a transaction, the wallet will typically provide you with the option to choose your Bitcoin fee rate. This charge will be determined in satoshis per unit of data (there are 100,000,000 satoshis in one Bitcoin) consumed on the blockchain by your transaction, abbreviated as sats/vByte. This rate will then be multiplied by the size of your transaction to get the total fee you'll pay.
If you want your transaction to be confirmed right away, your optimal fee rate may vary significantly. If you don't mind waiting, spending 2 sats/vByte will usually allow you to confirm your transaction within a day or a week.
Transaction fees also reflect the speed with which the user wants to have the transaction validated. When a user initiates a transaction, it goes into the mempool (transactions that have not yet been put to the blockchain and are being stored in volatile memory).
Upon validation, it is included in the block. Miners choose which transactions to validate and include in the block. When there is a backlog of transactions waiting to be validated, it creates an incentive for miners to process transactions with higher fee rates first. Most miners target transactions with high fee to byte ratios. When network transactions begin to reduce, transaction fees will fall.
Bitcoin exchanges, which connect buyers and sellers, calculate their fees in two ways: either a fixed fee per transaction or a percentage of total transaction volume over the previous 30 days. Exchanges use a tiered fee structure, depending on the total dollar volume transacted in both circumstances.
Fee arrangements are designed to encourage traders to trade frequently. As a result, costs for high-value and high-frequency transactions are correspondingly reduced. Fees for small, infrequent transactions are frequently higher."

60,2022-01-30,2022-01-30,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,www.theguardian.com,How do we solve bitcoin’s carbon problem?,"With bitcoin’s impact on the environment under scrutiny, experts debate whether a greener cryptocurrency is possible",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/30/how-do-we-solve-bitcoins-carbon-problem,"When bitcoin mining company Bit Digital started shipping its energy-intensive computers out of China in early 2021, eyebrows were raised. “A lot of people thought we were being overly paranoid,” says chief strategy officer Samir Tabar, who helped relocate all of the company’s machines to the US and Canada.
But the company’s paranoia paid off. China’s bitcoin mining ban last summer, driven partly by environmental concerns, sent the industry spinning into chaos. The announcement sparked a fire sale of the computers used to power bitcoin, with mining companies scrambling to ship more than 2m of the machines out of China. They arrived by the crateload in countries like the US, Russia and Kazakhstan.
China was home to about 65% of global bitcoin production in 2020, according to an estimate by the University of Cambridge. Although the country banned bitcoin mining for a number of reasons, one was the massive energy consumption bitcoin required and the impediment that posed to China’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2060.
Chinese regulators aren’t the only ones concerned by bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index estimates that bitcoin mining consumes 133.63 terawatt hours a year of electricity – more than the entire countries of Ukraine and Norway. This figure keeps growing: bitcoin mining currently uses 66 times more electricity than in 2015.

Bitcoiners like to say that China’s ban proved the resilience of the network. Although the “hashrate” – a measure of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin – plummeted around the time of the crackdown, it had recovered by the end of the year. But bitcoin’s energy consumption now poses an existential threat to the mining industry, with a growing number of lawmakers around the world eager to follow China’s lead.
Kazakhstan initially welcomed China’s stranded bitcoin miners as a potential boon to the economy. ​​Lured by the promise of lax regulation and cheap coal power, an estimated fifth of global bitcoin mining production migrated there. But bitcoin’s rapacious energy demand created intense pressure on Kazakhstan’s ageing energy grid this winter. The threat of emergency blackouts soon led the government to permit grid operators to limit power supply to miners, leaving some facilities without power.
Bitcoin’s rapacious energy demand created intense pressure on Kazakhstan’s ageing energy grid this winter
Even in renewable energy havens, the future of bitcoin mining is far from assured. Iceland, which gets almost all of its energy from renewables, won’t welcome any more bitcoin miners to its shores. Regulators in Sweden say that bitcoin mining siphons energy from more productive industries, and are currently lobbying the EU to ban the practice outright. Norway-based bitcoin miner Arcane’s CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen dismisses this as a “very planned-economy approach”. But even in the free-market-loving US, an increasing number of lawmakers are souring on the industry.
In theory, a greener bitcoin is possible. The digital coin’s energy consumption is tied to its underlying “proof-of-work” protocol (PoW). This is the decentralised consensus mechanism that secures the currency and prevents fraud or hacking, in the absence of oversight from banks or another centralised body. The role of bitcoin miners is essentially to verify transactions on the blockchain.
Think of bitcoin mining as a contest where miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The “winner” adds the next block of transactions to the distributed ledger (ie, the blockchain) and claims payment in the form of new bitcoins and a transaction fee. The miner using the most computing power is likely to solve the problem fastest, creating the incentive to expend more energy in order to “win”.

This ballooning energy consumption is fuelling the popularity of a less energy-intensive alternative: proof-of-stake (PoS).
Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, a blockchain platform that allows users to create smart contracts, says that a friend of hers ran a cryptography mailing list when bitcoin was first announced. “Arguably the first bitcoin sceptic”, his first reaction was, “‘If this is successful, it’s going to absorb all the energy in the universe, and it’s going to be terrible.’”
Tezos is built on PoS instead, which uses a consensus mechanism different from bitcoin’s. Rather than “miners” competing with computing power, different nodes of the distributed network compete by committing “stakes” of tokens. Staking a greater number of tokens – which risk being forfeited in the event of fraud – increases the likelihood that a node will be selected by an algorithm to produce the next block of transactions, receiving rewards in the form of more tokens.
Because it’s the “stake” (ie, the number of tokens) rather than “work” (ie, energy expenditure) that secures the network, PoS reduces network power demand by more than 99% relative to PoW. Instead of warehouses stacked high with purpose-built machines, PoS can run on a dinky Raspberry Pi microcomputer.
Although Breitman says environmental concerns aren’t what pushed her blockchain to pick PoS, it’s becoming more advantageous as scrutiny on PoW ramps up.
The problem with proof-of-stake is that it’s not trustless and it’s not censorship-resistant Chris Bendiksen, CoinShares
Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain after bitcoin, is planning to shift to PoS by the end of 2022, and a number of new blockchain applications such as Cardano and Polkadot have chosen to launch using this protocol.
The European Commission is among the regulatory bodies trying to incentivise the industry to migrate applications from PoW to PoS but the bitcoin network has so far resisted any such move.
It’s not that bitcoiners don’t care about the environmental impact – although a vocal minority on social media might give this impression, says digital assets lead at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), Michel Rauchs. The issue is that a majority of bitcoiners remain adamant that PoS is not a worthy replacement for PoW.

Many bitcoiners believe that PoS subverts the fundamental principles of a decentralised currency that must remain outside the reach of governments and the banking system. “The problem with proof-of-stake is that it’s not trustless and it’s not censorship-resistant, and it’s not objective,” says Chris Bendiksen, research lead at digital assets investment company CoinShares. “There’s no real difference from a high-level perspective between proof-of-stake and consensus shareholder capitalism… Proof-of-stake is not a replacement for proof-of-work, it’s just a return to the pre-bitcoin system.”
Some bitcoiners claim that the environmental debate is overblown because energy usage will fall over the coming years. This is because the profit miners receive for minting new coins is programmed to halve roughly every four years. Eventually, all bitcoins will be mined and miners will only receive transaction fees. “Since the [payment in the form of new coins] will go away and transaction fees won’t go up, electricity consumption will end up being much lower than the doomsayers believe,” says Pierre Rochard, a longtime bitcoin investor and developer. In other words, shrinking rewards should shrink the pool of competing miners.
Whether or not this will be the case, reluctance to rewire bitcoin’s underlying protocol tosses the ball back into the bitcoin miners’ court to tackle the issue of energy consumption.
They’re rising to the challenge – at least in rhetoric. Bitcoin mining is the cleanest and most efficient use of energy in the world out of any major industry, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, founder of the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), said in a recent briefing. “The only way you get more sustainable and more efficient would be to create an imaginary industry.” (More imaginary than bitcoin, that is.)
The idea that you have to create a new demand, like Bitcoin mining, is not correct Arvind Ravikumar, petroleum researcher
The BMC is a body of bitcoin miners set up last year to address growing concerns over the cryptocurrency’s energy consumption. Its purpose is to promote sustainability within the industry, but it’s also part of the fightback against bitcoin’s image problem.
The headline figure promoted at the meeting was that bitcoin accounts for only 0.1% of the Earth’s total energy consumption – which sounds a lot smaller than the frequent comparisons to small countries. (The 0.1% figure caught on fast among bitcoin miners – several quoted it to the Observer.) Rauchs said that the 0.1% figure sounded “roughly in line” with CCAF’s data.
What’s more, 58% of the energy used to power the industry is sustainable according to the BMC. A report from CCAF in 2020 estimated this figure at a more conservative 39%, but Rauchs stresses this was only a snapshot of energy consumption at that moment in time, and couldn’t comment on the reliability of the BMC’s estimate without seeing the underlying data.
Some bitcoiners argue that the cryptocurrency could incentivise a more rapid shift to renewable energy. Because bitcoin mining operations don’t have to be switched on all the time, they pair well with the intermittent nature of renewable energy according to the argument, and can compel energy companies to increase renewable energy capacity, as well as helping to balance the grid.
Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital Holdings, which runs operations in Nebraska, Texas and South Dakota, claims to have such agreements with power providers. “The company that generates the electricity can tell us to shut down our mining rigs,” says its CEO Fred Thiel, meaning “they’ll all of a sudden have 100-200 megawatts – whatever amount we’re consuming – available to put into the grid at a moment’s notice. We act like a big battery.”

There isn’t evidence that this is happening at scale yet, says Rauchs, although it could become more important in future. However, bitcoin mining is not particularly unique in this regard, says Arvind Ravikumar, a petroleum researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. Electric vehicle charging and so-called “tier zero” data centres that don’t support critical functions are also suited to these “demand response” arrangements that can be paired with renewable energy on the grid, he says. “The idea that you have to create a new demand, like bitcoin mining, is not correct.”
And the flipside is where growing energy demands incentivise defunct fossil fuel-powered stations to come back online. Controversially, bitcoin mining company Greenidge Generation Holdings reopened a former coal power plant in Dresden, New York, and converted it to natural gas, causing the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions to increase almost tenfold between 2019 and 2020.
Discussions about Bitcoin’s energy consumption tend to wind up in a philosophical cul-de-sac about the inherent utility of the industry. Critics contend that this utility is zero, which can provoke defensiveness in its advocates. “There are old-school bitcoiners who are like, ‘Who cares about the energy consumption? Bitcoin deserves to exist,’” says Breitman. “It becomes an argument about values.”
Many allege that energy overuse is simply the latest stick with which to beat bitcoin, and that the industry is subject to unfair moral scrutiny compared to others – like gold mining or Wall Street day trading. Rauchs is “actually pretty sympathetic” to that argument, saying bitcoiners are correct that hyperbole about bitcoin destroying years of climate progress is “completely out of proportion”. Whichever way you slice it, eliminating bitcoin isn’t a fast-track solution to global heating.
Ravikumar says the most important issue is what the industry is doing to reduce emissions. “That’s the question we need to be focusing on – rather than what, if any, are the benefits of Bitcoin mining.”"

It has been reported that $2.5 billion of crypto-related transactions were made via Visa in the first fiscal quarter of 2022. Despite the recent volatility, the demand for cryptocurrencies is still present.
Crypto Regulations
Despite the recent recovery, one of the main concerns are regulatory measures. The Russian government is currently heading for regulating the crypto markets instead of a complete ban (as proposed by the central bank). Putin stated that he backs crypto mining as it provides Russia with a competitive edge in the field.
Fitch credit rating agency warned that banning cryptocurrencies may curb innovation and negatively affect Russian banks' technological development.
It has been speculated that the Biden administration will issue an executive order on cryptocurrencies as early as next month. The speculations suggest cryptocurrencies are viewed as a national security threat by the US administration.

The shutdown of crypto miners in Kazakhstan is expected to end in February. The state electricity provider, KEGOC blamed crypto mining Crypto Mining Cryptocurrency mining is defined as the process through which the transactions of a digital currency are authenticated then published to blockchain. For every crypto transaction conducted, a crypto miner is in charge of authenticating the information which, if approved, is then updated in the blockchain. Currently, the most popular cryptocurrencies being mined are Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, Monero, and DASH. How is Cryptocurrency Mined?The process of crypto mining itself involves the solving of complex mathematical equations through the application of cryptographic hash functions. The crypto miner who can solve the solution first can authorize that cryptocurrency transaction while also receiving small cryptocurrency payments in exchange for services rendered. Crypto mining is competitive, tedious, and generally requires that miners possess advanced computers with specialized hardware, increased processing power, and an unwavering internet connection. Electricity, cost of internet, and computing hardware make up the bulk of the expenses that affect the net revenue created through crypto mining. Most cryptocurrency miners generate no than a couple of dollars per day. To perform crypto mining, miners must possess computer hardware that is accompanied by a graphical processing unit (GPU) chip or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Recommended computer brands include both Windows and Linux since non-Windows systems tend to have a difficult configuration process. Once acquired, crypto miners must ensure that they have a constant internet connection, have a means to cool-off hardware, possess a legitimate cryptocurrency mining software.Miners also often require membership with both online mining pools and cryptocurrency exchanges.

Currently, the most popular cryptocurrencies being mined are Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, Monero, and DASH. How is Cryptocurrency Mined?The process of crypto mining itself involves the solving of complex mathematical equations through the application of cryptographic hash functions. The crypto miner who can solve the solution first can authorize that cryptocurrency transaction while also receiving small cryptocurrency payments in exchange for services rendered. Crypto mining is competitive, tedious, and generally requires that miners possess advanced computers with specialized hardware, increased processing power, and an unwavering internet connection. Electricity, cost of internet, and computing hardware make up the bulk of the expenses that affect the net revenue created through crypto mining. Most cryptocurrency miners generate no than a couple of dollars per day. To perform crypto mining, miners must possess computer hardware that is accompanied by a graphical processing unit (GPU) chip or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Recommended computer brands include both Windows and Linux since non-Windows systems tend to have a difficult configuration process. Once acquired, crypto miners must ensure that they have a constant internet connection, have a means to cool-off hardware, possess a legitimate cryptocurrency mining software.Miners also often require membership with both online mining pools and cryptocurrency exchanges. Read this Term for the large outage that took place in the country.
As opposed to crude oil (nymex) where the price lifts when rigs are shutdown due a hurricane, a resumption of crypto mining may contribute to BTC recovery. Though, it may take a couple of weeks for the impact to seen.
Moreover, Armenia is making an old thermal plant available for the purpose of crypto mining. The old plant is to be rented to industrial firms that wish to use the plant for mining cryptocurrencies.
With time, crypto mining outages and resumption of mining may play a role in strategic fundamental analysis of cryptocurrencies.
Summary
To summarize, while the short-term trend for Bitcoin may be bearish, the broader fundamental outlook is suggesting some recovery. Partnerships may be fundamental drive for short-term volatility, which may increase until regulations are implemented. BTCUSD is trading at $37,830 at the time of writing."

The new platform features new additions to cater for the needs of individuals and companies seeking to pay and get paid in Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world. No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology. In fact, we’ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John’s.One could now argue that Bitcoin has now a global brand because of how everyone recognizes it even if they don’t really know what it is.Added to that, Bitcoin also has the largest market cap and liquidity pool which is why many find it to be the most attractive coin out there. Bitcoin summed up· Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating with no type of central control nor oversight from banks or governments, relying solely on its cryptography and peer-to-peer software.· A public ledger keeps track of all transactions by recording them. Copies are then held around the world on servers called nodes (which anyone can set up) and consensus is thus achieved on the state of the network.· Every single transaction is broadcasted publicly to the network and then shared between nodes. Miners lump these together into groups called blocks and add them permanently to the blockchain, Bitcoin’s definitive account book.· May 22 is known as the Bitcoin Pizza Day, marking the anniversary of BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real companyHow Does Bitcoin Work? Bitcoin is a completely neutral and decentralized asset which means no one is controlling it (no bankers or oligarchs pulling strings behind the curtain), and no central entity can issue or back it. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender in El Salvador and as it makes its way into our every day lives, other countries might soon follow suit. Bitcoin uses cryptography to assure its safety and reliability. Bitcoin transactions are verified by a process called mining which basically runs on computing power to solve mathematical puzzles. When trading Bitcoin its name is often abbreviated as BTC. What is a Blockchain Bitcoin’s system can be described as a group of computers (often called miners or nodes) which stores the Bitcoin blockchain and runs the Bitcoin code. The blockchain itself can be visualized as a string of blocks and within every block one can find immutable information, usually a collection of transactions, that are permanently recorded and which everyone can look into. Given that all of the Bitcoin network’s computers are running the exact same list of blocks, participants are assured of the process transparency because the ledger is maintained safely in this decentralized database. This makes it so that no trusted third party is necessary, and no single person is in control, rather all network participants are. As new information comes along, a freshly added block is minted and added to the blockchain while other nodes verify the whole thing. P2P Explained Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is meant to make instant payments easier. Bitcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement P2P and its system shifts the responsibility of processing the blockchain transactions to Bitcoin miners while giving them rewards for doing so. Bitcoin miners act as a decentralized authority which enforces the Bitcoin network’s credibility by performing these tasks and maintaining the Bitcoin ledger. The best-known case for the success of peer-to-peer BTC transactions probably lies in countries like Venezuela and El Salvador in which the younger generations have made strides in the coin’s mass adoption in their respective countries. How Does Bitcoin Make Money? Many people are still purchasing Bitcoins for the asset’s investment value rather than its capabilities of being used as a medium of exchange. As such, the asset has a speculative side which cannot be ignored due to how it correlates with its price volatility. How To Get Bitcoin? How to get into Bitcoin is a fairly easy process. Aside from the Bitcoin mining process, the asset can be exchanged for standard currencies even though it is not backed by any form of government or central entity like a bank. The Bitcoin exchange rate against the US Dollar keeps attracting investors and traders. Luckily, even the uninitiated won’t be needing a “bitcoin for dummies” guide because the asset is normally bought through a Bitcoin exchange to which you can wire money or simply pay with your credit card. Just remember to look for BTC (BTC meaning is obviously Bitcoin but there are altcoins which might try to pose as the original). Bitcoin Mining: How Are Bitcoins Created? Bitcoins are created through a process which is open for everyone to participate known as Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining consists of solving mathematical puzzles by means of one’s computational power, meaning that mining systems will in fact compete with one another for the asset. How Do I Start Mining Bitcoin? Even though the bitcoin digital world welcomes all with open arms, mining new bitcoins isn’t really a Bitcoin for beginners type of thing. If you want to venture into mining Bitcoins, the most obvious entry barriers are the expensive ASIC systems which you will need and the high electrical bills they will run up. ASIC stands for application-specific integrated chip. Bitcoin ASIC systems are custom bitcoin mining machines and are unquestionably one of the largest investments for bitcoin miners given that prices start at 4 figures and miners organize thousands of these into their mining pools (one ASIC system alone will potentially generate less than one single bitcoin). Network infrastructure may also be an issue as miners will need uninterrupted internet access with the least possible latency. The Bitcoin mining process has thus turned into a costly endeavor with no guaranteed results. Bitcoin Security Explained Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which is distributed in a peer-to-peer network, making it very resistant to censorship and confiscation. Bitcoin technology boasts its safety by relying on several factors such as its blockchain, the fact that it is cryptographic, decentralized, and permissionless. Being public and decentralized boosts the asset’s security as nodes verify every transaction and maintain the ledger. As such, theoretically, one would need to control over half of all the nodes to be able to manipulate it, something which albeit not impossible is certainly highly unlikely. How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin has been growing at a steady pace and some brick-and-mortar merchants have begun to accept it as means of payment for goods and services. Online, the asset has also found its way as an accepted online payment option on pair with credit cards or Paypal. How to Buy Bitcoin Buying Bitcoin is a straightforward process. A buyer will simply need to pick a broker, opt for a paying option (wiring money, credit card, etc.), place an order, and select a safe storage option for his or her coins. Keep in mind that you should be looking for Bitcoin or BTC and not things like “Bit coin” or “bitcoin cryptocurrency” because there have been known scams and fake coins, so stick with reputable brokers. Where Can I Buy Bitcoin? Buying Bitcoin is mostly done through Bitcoin brokers, many of which will ask you for your KYC data (know your customer data: name, address, and so forth). As such, some concerns were raised over the asset’s security and user anonymity, which is why non-KYC options were also created. However, non-KYC Bitcoin buying might not be entirely legal depending on where the buyer lives. Storing your Bitcoins There are different ways of storing your Bitcoins. Regarded as the safest way of holding Bitcoin, an offline wallet (also known as cold storage or hardware wallet) is usually the go-to option for most people because of how these Bitcoin wallets are not accessible through the Internet and thus keep the asset safe offline. By not being connect to the internet, cold wallets have a much smaller risk of being compromised. However, some will prefer to store the asset in hot wallets which run on internet-connected devices (phones, computers, etc.). Investing in Bitcoin Why Is Bitcoin Valuable? Scarcity is an important element to why Bitcoin has value. Having unlimited supply will obviously not translate to being a good store of value. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million. Another factor to consider is that the asset is being considered by many as “freedom money” given that it cannot be inflated away, nor can it be censored or confiscated. This makes it self-evident that Bitcoins are standing above concepts like sovereignty, user’s personal preferences, creeds, and so forth. Moreover, the monetary policy some of the newer crypto projects out there can be altered at a moment’s notice, whereas Bitcoin’s monetary policy was fixed at its inception, meaning that it is a much steadier asset than any of its other digital counterparts. Can Bitcoin be converted to cash? Bitcoin can be converted to cash through third-party broker exchanges. The process requires the seller to deposit his or her Bitcoins into the exchange and, once verification that the asset was received takes place, a withdrawal request for fiat currency can be made. The money will then be wired into the sellers account and usually the broker will require you to use the same account which is connected to it (as to prevent money laundering schemes). Another less used method one can resort to are peer-to-peer selling platforms.There are at least 3 things to consider before cashing out your Bitcoin: taxes, fees, and speed Bitcoin Investing Risks Every investment comes with risk. Bitcoin, albeit being a digital asset, is no different. In fact, there are some risks you should know about when dealing with BTC. Regulatory risk Decentralization comes at a price. As Bitcoin makes great strides into our everyday lives and begins to be recognized as legal tender, it inherently becomes a competitor to fiat, or government currency. Obviously, it can (and many are certain that it already has) become a digital medium for illegal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and other underground market payments. This makes it clear that governments will look into either regulate, restrict, or even attempt to ban its use and/or sale. Other efforts might include actively enforcing KYC requirements to brokers or having participants reporting transactions over a certain amount. Regardless, the lack of Bitcoin regulation, especially in a uniformed manner, will certainly make some weary about its longevity and universality. Security risk As the Bitcoin mining process barriers of entry get higher and higher, it comes as no surprise that many Bitcoin holders will have acquired it by resorting to one of the many available online exchanges. As it happens with everything digital, these exchanges are also risk prone either by malware, glitches or even hackers. If a hacker takes over one’s computer and manages to get his or her hands on a private encryption key, they will be easily able to steal Bitcoin (and remember, Bitcoin transactions are permanent and there is no insurance or refunds). The exchanges themselves are honeypots due to how some of their users simply aren’t resorting to holding their Bitcoin in safer places. Insurance risk Bitcoin accounts and exchanges are usually not insured in any way. However, some exchanges have begun to provide Bitcoin insurance to its investors, namely with FDIC insurance for a portion of transactions which involve cash. Fraud risk Bitcoin encryption through private keys allows for ownership verification and transactions to be registered. However, there have been known cases of scammers attempting to sell fake Bitcoin or operating Bitcoin Ponzi schemes. Market risk Bitcoin value fluctuates and cryptocurrency volatility is a quite common occurrence in the digital crypto sphere. As such, Bitcoin price swings are to be expected. As an example of how extreme things can go, Bitcoin fell about 80% in one single day in 2014. People have brought up the subject of the Bitcoin bubble time and time again, but the truth is that the project is holding on despite having plenty of competitors. So, Is Bitcoin a Good Investment? A good investment can be defined in many ways. Bitcoin investments can greatly vary due to how some people interpret it as a speculative short-term play while others see it as a hedge against inflation or aim for long-term adoption and appreciation. It will come down to one’s own perception and assessment of the investment’s risk and reward. What Are the Issues with Bitcoin? Volatility is still and issue with Bitcoin as is the lack of true anonymity. However, the main issue with the digital asset is as its popularity keeps growing, it becomes slower and slower, cumbersome, and, more importantly, expensive to use. Transactions take a long time to be validated and fees have skyrocketed, meaning that Bitcoin is slowly walking a path in which might lead to its unviability as medium of exchange. Electricity consumption has also been a source of concern. The History: Who created Bitcoin? While some people still believe that there is someone who owns Bitcoin, the truth is that Bitcoin has had a somewhat immaculate conception in the world of finance. It is a unique historical “accident” that one might say it would probably be impossible to recreate (as many of the newer digital projects have unfortunately shown us). Anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto (who can either be an individual or group of individuals) left the project very early on and as we all know every prominent cryptocurrency creator who sticks around can be turned into a single point of failure of the project, meaning that taking credit for the project could in fact hurt it. Moreover, Bitcoins value was near zero for a long time given despite having first mover advantage. That got to fly under the radar of both the public and the regulators unlike the newer projects out there. When Was Bitcoin Created? The Bitcoin white paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the original software which runs the asset was released the following year. Bitcoin Forking History Throughout Bitcoin’s history there have been some accounts of disagreement between miners and developers with even factions being created. These led to significant splits in the community which surrounds crypto and the asset, some of which led to the point in which a “fork” had to be performed on the network. Forking happens as developers or miners believe that a significant change must be made in the network’s protocol.In this particular case, the process led to the creation of a new type of Bitcoin with a completely different name. If the new coin is set to share the previous coin’s transaction history up to the split point, the process is considered to be a “hard fork”. Bitcoin Cash (launched in August 2017), Bitcoin Gold (launched in October 2017), and Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (launched in November 2018) were all a result of a hard fork in Bitcoin’s network. If the fork, however, allows for the protocol to remain compatible with its previous iteration, that it is known as a “soft fork”. Bitcoin’s functionalities like SegWit are a result of soft forks in the network. What is Bitcoin Concluded While some believe Bitcoin to be the future of currency, others see it as a speculative play. Regardless of how people see Bitcoin, the decentralized aspect of the project completely revolutionized finance and the world itself much akin to how gold overcame seashells many, many centuries ago. With no central control or oversight from governments or banks, Bitcoin is inessence an unbelievably strong social consensus with a monetary policy written in stone and a max supply which can be compared to a religious dogma. FAQ Can Bitcoin be Considered a Real Currency? Bitcoin is referred to by many as a form of digital currency and/or the main alternative to fiat money which is controlled by central entities such as banks. Bitcoin differs due to how no monetary authority can issue it and, as we know, currencies offer value due to their ability to operate as a store of value and, obviously, as a unit of exchange. People who aren’t digitally native or who can’t go beyond the concept of fiat currency may still wonder what do bitcoins look like but there are other countries which have made great strides into adapting themselves to this new currency. Countries like El Salvador, for example, have recognized it as legal tender, which means that if you ask someone over there questions like how to get into bitcoin, what is bitcoin and how does it work, they’ll have the answer on the tip of their tongue even if they don’t know bitcoins definition. The revolution might have just begun, and we might see Bitcoin being used on a daily basis much like credit cards. Why do people want Bitcoins? The reasons why people want Bitcoins can greatly vary. While some believe it will be the currency of the future, assuming that we’re going digital on all fronts, others just use it for speculative plays and quick profits. What makes Bitcoin a new kind of money? Mainly, what makes Bitcoin a new kind of money is its digital, decentralized nature. Many crypto enthusiasts call Bitcoin “freedom money”. Your bank accounts can be frozen, your licenses can even be revoked, the list goes on. If a government has immunity over their actions and is able freeze your assets on just the slight suspicion of wrongdoing (or if they find out you don’t support their “regime”) then it might be the time to do so and start looking at Bitcoin differently because they can try and try again but no one will be able to fully stop peer-to-peer bitcoin or lightning transactions to and from non-custodial wallets, meaning people will still be able to receive and send bitcoins as they please. What is the purpose of Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s original purpose was to provide a way for people to be able to send money over the internet and to provide a digital, decentralized alternative in what concerns payment systems. This is the main reason why some people out there love bitcoin more than cash. How Many Bitcoins Are There? By design, Bitcoins supply is hard capped at 21 million, meaning that its supply is finite.After the asset’s supply reaches 21 million, no additional coins will be generated. Is Bitcoin a Scam? Bitcoin is intangible but its value is certainly real and its presence in the financial world is robust and longstanding. With that being said, there are scammers out there who will try to swindle people with nefarious tactics and scams. Nonetheless, these problems are rooted in human behavior and not in the coin itself. The digital asset’s code is open source, and anyone can download and review it. Can you buy a house with Bitcoin? Buying a house with Bitcoins or another digital crypto asset is certainly a very real possibility. To do so, one should look for a real estate agency which has experience dealing with Bitcoins and crypto transactions. However, keep in mind that a mortgage on the property might not be possible due to how some banks are still hesitant on the asset. Even if the coin is world famous now, there are still many places where you’ll be asked what is btc. However, if the seller will accept Bitcoin, the only thing left is to negotiate the selling price in BTC. Who controls Bitcoin price? Bitcoin is not issued by an entity like a central bank, nor it is backed by a government. Accordingly, monetary policy, and other measurements of economic growth simply do not apply when dealing with Bitcoins. However, its price can still be influenced by a variety of factors like the digital asset’s supply, the market’s demand, the cost of producing it, the miners’ rewards, regulations regarding the asset’s sale and use, news developments, competing crypto, and so forth. How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin? The length it takes can vary depending on the block reward’s amount (how much will crypto miners will receive for generating a new block).It is estimated that on average a new block is produced every 10 minutes, meaning that a new Bitcoin gets mined approximately every 1.6 minutes. Is mining Bitcoin illegal? The legality of this process will most likely solely depend on your geographic location. As Bitcoin threatens fiat currencies’ dominance and governmental control, the digital asset has been declared to be completely illegal in some countries. With that being said, ownership and the coin’s mining process are still legal in many more countries than not. While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world. No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.

Regardless of how people see Bitcoin, the decentralized aspect of the project completely revolutionized finance and the world itself much akin to how gold overcame seashells many, many centuries ago. With no central control or oversight from governments or banks, Bitcoin is inessence an unbelievably strong social consensus with a monetary policy written in stone and a max supply which can be compared to a religious dogma. FAQ Can Bitcoin be Considered a Real Currency? Bitcoin is referred to by many as a form of digital currency and/or the main alternative to fiat money which is controlled by central entities such as banks. Bitcoin differs due to how no monetary authority can issue it and, as we know, currencies offer value due to their ability to operate as a store of value and, obviously, as a unit of exchange. People who aren’t digitally native or who can’t go beyond the concept of fiat currency may still wonder what do bitcoins look like but there are other countries which have made great strides into adapting themselves to this new currency. Countries like El Salvador, for example, have recognized it as legal tender, which means that if you ask someone over there questions like how to get into bitcoin, what is bitcoin and how does it work, they’ll have the answer on the tip of their tongue even if they don’t know bitcoins definition. The revolution might have just begun, and we might see Bitcoin being used on a daily basis much like credit cards. Why do people want Bitcoins? The reasons why people want Bitcoins can greatly vary. While some believe it will be the currency of the future, assuming that we’re going digital on all fronts, others just use it for speculative plays and quick profits. What makes Bitcoin a new kind of money? Mainly, what makes Bitcoin a new kind of money is its digital, decentralized nature. Many crypto enthusiasts call Bitcoin “freedom money”. Your bank accounts can be frozen, your licenses can even be revoked, the list goes on. If a government has immunity over their actions and is able freeze your assets on just the slight suspicion of wrongdoing (or if they find out you don’t support their “regime”) then it might be the time to do so and start looking at Bitcoin differently because they can try and try again but no one will be able to fully stop peer-to-peer bitcoin or lightning transactions to and from non-custodial wallets, meaning people will still be able to receive and send bitcoins as they please. What is the purpose of Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s original purpose was to provide a way for people to be able to send money over the internet and to provide a digital, decentralized alternative in what concerns payment systems. This is the main reason why some people out there love bitcoin more than cash. How Many Bitcoins Are There? By design, Bitcoins supply is hard capped at 21 million, meaning that its supply is finite.After the asset’s supply reaches 21 million, no additional coins will be generated. Is Bitcoin a Scam? Bitcoin is intangible but its value is certainly real and its presence in the financial world is robust and longstanding. With that being said, there are scammers out there who will try to swindle people with nefarious tactics and scams. Nonetheless, these problems are rooted in human behavior and not in the coin itself. The digital asset’s code is open source, and anyone can download and review it. Can you buy a house with Bitcoin? Buying a house with Bitcoins or another digital crypto asset is certainly a very real possibility. To do so, one should look for a real estate agency which has experience dealing with Bitcoins and crypto transactions. However, keep in mind that a mortgage on the property might not be possible due to how some banks are still hesitant on the asset. Even if the coin is world famous now, there are still many places where you’ll be asked what is btc. However, if the seller will accept Bitcoin, the only thing left is to negotiate the selling price in BTC. Who controls Bitcoin price? Bitcoin is not issued by an entity like a central bank, nor it is backed by a government. Accordingly, monetary policy, and other measurements of economic growth simply do not apply when dealing with Bitcoins. However, its price can still be influenced by a variety of factors like the digital asset’s supply, the market’s demand, the cost of producing it, the miners’ rewards, regulations regarding the asset’s sale and use, news developments, competing crypto, and so forth. How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin? The length it takes can vary depending on the block reward’s amount (how much will crypto miners will receive for generating a new block).It is estimated that on average a new block is produced every 10 minutes, meaning that a new Bitcoin gets mined approximately every 1.6 minutes. Is mining Bitcoin illegal? The legality of this process will most likely solely depend on your geographic location. As Bitcoin threatens fiat currencies’ dominance and governmental control, the digital asset has been declared to be completely illegal in some countries. With that being said, ownership and the coin’s mining process are still legal in many more countries than not. Read this Term.

63,2022-01-30,2022-01-30,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Rachel Wolfson,cointelegraph.com,Bitcoin miners believe global hash rate to grow ‘aggressively’,"Bitcoin miners explain why the Bitcoin network is the strongest it's ever been while commenting on the need for green energy, benefits of IPOs and stronger blockchain innovation.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-believe-global-hash-rate-to-grow-aggressively,"Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be on everyone’s mind lately as the world recently witnessed the price of BTC take a rather unexpected bearish turn this month. On January 21, 2022, Bitcoin reached six-month lows, sinking below $40,000 for the first time in months.
While some panicked, other industry experts pointed out that the Bitcoin network has become verifiably stronger than ever before. The growth of the Bitcoin network has become apparent, as hash rate figures for BTC continue to set new highs this month. For example, on Jan. 22, the BTC network recorded an all-time high of 26.643 trillion with an average hash rate of 190.71 exahash per second (EH/s).
The hash rate will continue to grow, which is a good thing
Samir Tabar, chief strategy officer at Bit Digital — a publicly listed Bitcoin miner — told Cointelegraph that the BTC hash rate refers to the amount of computing power being contributed to the network at any given time. Tabar explained that when it comes to Bitcoin mining, a higher hash rate equates to a good hash rate. “The more computing power going towards maintaining a network, the more secure it will be and the more transactions it will be able to handle,” said Tabar.
As such, the recent hash rate figures for Bitcoin are extremely notable, even with the price of BTC being down. Peter Wall, CEO of crypto mining firm Argo Blockchain, told Cointelegraph that he wasn’t surprised to see the BTC hash rate hit close to 200 EH/s. Wall further stated that even with events that have recently disrupted BTC mining hash rate like the political upheaval in Kazakhstan, the hash rate will continue to grow higher each month:
“Argo Blockchain’s mining margin last year in 2021, which is our revenue minus our direct costs, was over 80%. It was a very good year for miners. In 2020, where BTC prices were much lower, our margin was 41%. So, this year I think we will still see strong margins in the space despite the recent drop in the price of Bitcoin and the increase in the hash rate.”
Darin Feinstein, co-founder and co-chairman of Core Scientific — a major publicly-traded blockchain infrastructure provider — told Cointelegraph that based on previous Bitcoin mining hash rate data, the BTC network grew by 200% following the mass exodus of miners from China:
“The Bitcoin network one year ago was approximately 143 EH/s. Following the mining ban in China, the network fell to 63 EH/s. Today, the hash rate has grown to approximately 198 EH/s. This recent increase represents three important metrics. One, it represents a 130 EH hash rate increase on the network. Two, it represents 130 EH of new hosting infrastructure and primarily new generation hardware deployment and three, this deployment has taken place in geographic regions that use far cleaner energy than the energy used in China.”
With this in mind, Feinstein noted that even though the BTC network has hit all-time highs in terms of EH/s, due to the massive improvements in miner chip technology and geographic distribution away from China, the network is now the most efficient and sustainable than it has ever been. Feinstein added that this data is important because it shows how much energy every terahash uses, which is generally represented by a metric called jules/terahash. He noted that this ratio has fallen greatly over the last several years, demonstrating a major increase in mining energy efficiency.

Will infrastructure support network growth?
Michael Levitt, co-founder chairman and CEO of Core Scientific, told Cointelegraph that he fully anticipates for the BTC global hash rate to continue growing at an aggressive pace.
However, Levitt mentioned that this growth is dependent on the price of Bitcoin moving forward, along with the success of the infrastructure currently being built. “The amount of infrastructure expected will be challenged by global supply chain issues,” he remarked.
Feinstein added that infrastructure is the biggest challenge when it comes to mining Bitcoin. “The bottlenecks for Bitcoin mining are land, energy, equipment, and lastly, infrastructure. There is plenty of ASIC hardware to be purchased, energy and land are also readily available, but miners need a place to plug in power, and, historically, that is where miners run into issues,” he commented.
North America has become one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining hubs, as per data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, which shows that 35% of the average monthly BTC hash rate comes from the United States, while 10% comes from Canada. Wall explained that North America has taken the lead as a global Bitcoin mining hub for a number of reasons. “This is the case due to the region’s crypto-friendly jurisdiction, its stable regulatory environment, pro-innovation nature and, most importantly, access to the most important thing miners need — low-cost power, preferably renewable.”
Wall elaborated that the low costs of power in the U.S. have been significant for miners, especially when organizations tap into the right part of the power grid. “We’ve seen significant growth in Texas over the last 12 months,” he said.
Cointelegraph previously reported that the Bitcoin mining industry in Texas consumed around 500 to 1,000 megawatts (MW) of power during Nov. 2021. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas reportedly anticipates that demand could increase as much as fivefold by 2023 and has planned an additional 3,000 to 5,000 MW.
Wall elaborated that many miners are moving to Texas due to the fact that the state operates its own power grid that consists of a high degree of power from sustainable generation sources, but needs more flexible demand, or load:
“Miners can provide a consistent load that is flexible. It’s also helpful that Texas has demand response programs in place, where miners will shut down and give power back to the grid when there is high demand. This makes the grid more resilient.”
Benefits such as these have prompted Argo Blockchain to build its next 200 MW facility in Dickens County, west Texas, directly next to a 5.5-gigawatt substation. “There is a lot of congestion at that substation and they need local load to relieve it. The power from west Texas needs to go a long way to reach major urban cities like Dallas and Houston. But, if we can use that energy much closer to where it’s being generated, that relieves the congestion,” remarked Wall.
By drawing power from a nearby substation, Argo Blockchain is demonstrating the use of sustainable energy. According to Wall, the mining company has been carbon negative since 2020. This is important, as Tabar stated that a massive environmental, social and governance movement is currently facing the crypto mining industry:
“Miners must draw from clean sources of power or else they will be regulated out of business. It can’t always be about the cheapest sources of power. Miners will eventually suffer valuation discounts if they use dirty power, even if that source is cheap.”
The perks of going public
A rush of mining firms to go public is another trend the Bitcoin mining industry is likely to witness this year. Most recently, Texas-based Bitcoin mining company Rhodium announced plans to offer 7.69 million shares at $12–$14 each in an initial public offering (IPO).
Core Scientific went public on Jan. 20 after merging with Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition in a SPAC transaction. Although shares of Core Scientific have fallen since then, Feinstein mentioned that every publicly listed crypto company — like Coinbase, Galaxy Digital and others — brings institutional investment opportunities to the U.S. market. “This is enhancing and bringing credibility to the entire industry,” he remarked.
Levitt added that Bitcoin miners going public brings about a number of benefits, including better access to capital while having publicly traded equity that can be used for acquiring and building other businesses. Moreover, Levitt added that having a public presence is useful for conversations in and around the financial services industry. “However, the principal benefit is much more ready access to capital for growing and developing our business,” said Levitt."

A new Russian law may oblige potential crypto investors to take a test before being allowed to purchase digital assets over a certain limit. The authors are also hoping to regulate cryptocurrency mining and cut access to cheap energy for those who mint coins in their homes.
Bill to Bring ‘Tight Regulation’ to Crypto Industry, Strict Requirements for Investors
Russian lawmakers are working on a law to fill regulatory gaps in the crypto space. The legislation may introduce special exams for non-qualified investors who want to buy cryptocurrencies with a total annual value exceeding 600,000 rubles ($7,700). One of its sponsors, the Deputy Chair of the parliamentary Security and Anti-Corruption Committee Andrey Lugovoy, told the daily Izvestia that the new law is about “tight regulation” of the sector.
The bill is expected to hit the floor of the State Duma during the spring session of the lower house of parliament, the deputy noted. Before that, it will be discussed with relevant ministries, law enforcement agencies, and market players. Any amendments will be approved by a working group comprising members of the Duma and representatives of government institutions, including the Central Bank of Russia.
The monetary authority has been at loggerheads with other regulators over its hardline stance on cryptocurrencies. In a recently published consultation paper, the Bank of Russia proposed a wide-ranging ban on crypto-related activities such as issuing, trading, and mining which has failed to gain support from the executive and legislative powers in Moscow.
New Law to Regulate Crypto Mining and Exchange
Andrey Lugovoy also revealed that the upcoming law will attempt to regulate cryptocurrency mining which has been expanding in Russia, especially after the crackdown on the industry in China. Besides companies, ordinary people in energy-rich regions have found an additional income source, taking advantage of subsidized electricity with crypto farms running in basements and garages.
Electricity tariffs for these miners should be the same as those for businesses, the lawmaker told the publication, insisting that “garage mining” with cheap household power should be stopped. In late December, the federal government took a step in that direction by allowing regional authorities to raise electricity rates for residential areas when consumption exceeds a certain threshold.
The authors of the bill plan to clearly define which entities will be permitted to work with cryptocurrencies. These will include authorized banks, provided they obtain a special license, crypto exchanges, and other digital money exchangers. Foreign-based crypto trading platforms that want to operate in the Russian Federation will be subject to a “special” registration regime, Lugovoy remarked without elaborating further.

65,2022-01-31,2022-01-31,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Vildana Hajric,Akayla Gardner",www.aljazeera.com,Bitcoin on track for its worst January since 2018 ‘crypto winter’,"Bitcoin dipped to as low as $33,000 in January from a record of almost $69,000 less than three months ago.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/31/bitcoin-on-track-for-its-worst-january-since-2018-crypto-winter,"Bitcoin dipped to as low as $33,000 in January from a record of almost $69,000 less than three months ago.
Bitcoin is closing out a rough month, with January declines putting the digital coin on pace for its worst start to a year since the dawn of the 2018 “crypto winter.”
The largest cryptocurrency by market value has notched only 11 up days this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, meaning that it’s spent 65% of the month mired in a decline. Other digital assets have also suffered, with No. 2 token Ether down roughly 30% since the end of December.
Bitcoin dipped to as low as $33,000 in January from a record of almost $69,000 less than three months ago amid a broader selloff in risk assets on growing conviction that the Federal Reserve will soon raise rates as it ratchets back its ultra-accommodative policy settings. The plunge has hit all corners of the crypto ecosystem, from Bitcoin and memecoins to publicly-listed crypto exchanges and miners.
“Crypto is a very volatile asset class — and I hope that everyone participating in that market is aware of the volatility potential,” Troy Gayeski, chief market strategist at FS Investments, said by phone. “It’s a much trickier environment than it was six months ago, 12 months ago, 18 months ago where it was ‘green-light go.’ Now it’s ‘yellow-light caution.’”
On Monday, Bitcoin fell as much as 2.9% to trade at around $36,680 before recouping losses. Its monthly decline now stands at more than 18%, the worst start to a year since 2018’s 29% decline and a grim follow-up to December’s 19% slump.
The declines in prices have also translated to lower volume, according to a report from CryptoCompare.
“Macro sentiment around risk assets has been the leading narrative in the markets, with expectations of significant tapering of quantitative easing” following a string of hot inflation prints, wrote analysts in the report. Digital-asset investment products have seen outflows for the first time since August, with weekly outflows averaging $88 million so far in January, they said. And total assets under management for Bitcoin products have fallen by 23% since December.
Bitcoin lost roughly 50% from its November peak to its January lows. That decline puts it at “the low end of the range” of big drawdowns, historically speaking, according to Goldman Sachs’s Zach Pandl and Isabella Rosenberg. The pair estimate that since 2011, there have been five previous major pullbacks for the coin off of then all-time highs, with an average peak-to-trough decline of 77%. On average, the declines lasted seven to eight months, they wrote in a note. Bitcoin’s largest cumulative decline — a loss of 93% — happened in 2011, they said.
While the market’s recent turbulence may not be as rattling to crypto veterans who are accustomed to its volatility, many investors have only gotten in relatively recently, making the swift slump particularly painful.
“I’ve always said if you’re uncomfortable waking up to a 30%, 40%, even 50% decline for whatever reason, you probably shouldn’t own it,” said Gayeski.
And memories of the last “crypto winter” – a phrase endemic to the digital-asset space that refers to a sharp slump followed by months of doldrums – are renewing fears that a repeat could be playing out currently. The last such decline happened in 2018, when Bitcoin fell roughly 80% and subsequently took more than a year to reach another high.
“While the selloff in Bitcoin has been relatively muted going into this week, the outlook for the cryptocurrency market as a whole remains negative with heavy losses seen across a range of once-popular altcoins,” said Nicholas Cawley, Strategist at DailyFX. “If the market as a whole is looking to Bitcoin to lead the way higher, it is most likely to be disappointed.”"

The Diem project, initially called Libra when it was unveiled in 2019, almost immediately ran into fierce opposition from regulators concerned that it could give Facebook too much control over the money system and infringe on users' privacy.
In its quest for regulatory approvals, Facebook renamed both the digital coin and the wallet it was building to process transactions, now called Novi.

70,2022-02-02,2022-02-02,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Krystal Hur,www.cnbc.com,Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor says clear crypto regulations would speed institutional adoption,"The MicroStrategy CEO told CNBC on Wednesday he's looking for ""clear, bright line definitions"" around a digital security versus a digital currency.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/bitcoin-evangelist-michael-saylor-says-clear-crypto-regulations-would-speed-institutional-adoption.html,"Tighter government crypto regulations would actually be a positive catalyst for bitcoin, MicroStrategy co-founder and CEO Michael Saylor told CNBC on Wednesday.
""Additional regulatory clarity from the [Biden] administration is going to benefit bitcoin and accelerate institutional adoption of that asset,"" Saylor said on ""Squawk on the Street,"" stressing as a major bitcoin believer and holder he's looking for ""clear, bright line definitions of digital property versus a digital security versus a digital currency and the operating rules of the digital exchange.""
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said last month that the agency is planning to crack down on Wall Street, including by creating and enacting rules for cryptocurrency markets. Back in August, Gensler said Congress needs to grant the SEC additional powers to regulate crypto.
Saylor, a prominent advocate for bitcoin whose company has invested heavily in the digital currency, attributed crypto market volatility to high speed trading, saying he believes that inevitable widespread adoption will help stabilize the market.
""The most important point is that Big Tech and Big Finance and billions of people around the world need a digital property solution,"" Saylor said. ""We have a technically sound, economically sound, morally sound, politically sound path forward, and that's bitcoin. I think people are starting to realize that now.""
Catalysts for widespread adoption of crypto, according to Saylor, include the approval of spot bitcoin ETF proposals and regulatory approval to use fair value accounting for bitcoin holdings.
The SEC recently objected to an accounting method MicroStrategy used in its quarterly financial reports. The enterprise software firm had been issuing a non-GAAP operating income figure that excluded impairment losses related to its bitcoin holdings, analysts at BTIG explained in a recent note.
As of Jan. 31, MicroStrategy owned 125,051 bitcoins, CFO Phong Le said on the company's earnings call Tuesday. At current prices around $37,400 per coin, that stake was worth nearly $4.7 billion. Le said the firm's average purchase price was $30,200 per unit, including fees and expenses.
Saylor was less bombastic in Wednesday's interview, compared to past CNBC appearances. Just about a year ago, he predicted on ""Squawk Box"" that bitcoin's market value would reach $100 trillion one day.
Bitcoin, which is the world's largest digital currency, had a total market value around $709 billion on Wednesday, according to CoinMarketCap, with the entire crypto market only worth $1.7 trillion.
The price of bitcoin, known for its volatility, has fallen on hard times recently, trading nearly 50% below its all-time high near $69,000 per unit in November.

71,2022-02-02,2022-02-02,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Keith Noonan,www.fool.com,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Coinbase Were Sinking Today",The cryptocurrency-market's slide today snapped some recent rebound momentum.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/02/02/why-bitcoin-ethereum-and-coinbase-were-sinking-tod/,"What happened
Cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks were under pressure again in Wednesday's trading. Bitcoin (BTC 2.83%) and Ethereum (ETH 4.27%) were down roughly 4.5% and 4.1%, respectively, over the previous 24-hour period as of 5:30 p.m. ET, and Coinbase Global (COIN 4.30%) saw its stock end the daily trading session down 5.2%.
Most top-50 cryptocurrencies are in the red over the last 24 hours of trading, and it looks like investors are taking some money off the table on the heels of recent pricing rebounds. Coinbase stock lost ground amid a pullback for the broader cryptocurrency market despite the Nasdaq Composite index ending the daily trading session up roughly 0.5% and the S&P 500 climbing roughly 0.9%.
So what
There doesn't appear to be any major new cryptocurrency or company-specific news behind sell-offs for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Coinbase today. With the Federal Reserve likely on track to implement significant interest-rate hikes this year, and a multitude of other risk factors on the horizon, sustained bullish momentum for stocks and cryptocurrencies has been hard to come by early in 2022. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Coinbase have seen some valuation gains recently, but momentum reversed on Wednesday.
Despite today's sell-offs, Bitcoin was up roughly 1.7% over the last seven days of trading, as of this writing, while Ethereum's Ether token was up roughly 10.3%. Coinbase is also in the green over the last week, with its share price up roughly 10% across the stretch.
Even with dramatic pricing volatility, Bitcoin and Ethereum's respective tokens have still managed to post significant gains over the last year.
Ethereum has far outperformed Bitcoin across the stretch, and there appears to be a general trend of investors shifting toward application-backed tokens and away from those that function solely as currencies and speculative investment vehicles. Still, the tokens each are trading down roughly 46% from the lifetime highs they hit in November. Meanwhile, Coinbase stock is down roughly 43% from market close on the day of its initial public offering and roughly 56% from its lifetime high.
Now what
Cryptocurrencies have generally been bearish, as investors have weighed macroeconomic and regulatory threats and become more risk averse. This trend has extended to Coinbase stock. Huge valuation swings in recent months should make it clear that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Coinbase are risky investments.
The cryptocurrency market will likely continue to see volatile pricing action, and it's reasonable to expect that pricing moves will continue to have a significant impact on Coinbase stock. It's possible that cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks will bounce back from recent turbulence and go on to reach new highs, but there's still room for more sell-offs, despite the substantial valuation pullbacks.
Cryptocurrency-valuation trends have tended to be highly cyclical, and the massive price appreciation of Bitcoin's and Ethereum's tokens over the last five years could set the stage for more dramatic valuation slides. If the two market-leading tokens suffer more significant bearish pressures, it's likely that other cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks would also be impacted. Accordingly, investors should continue to keep the crypto space's high-risk, high-reward dynamic in mind."

Hump-day provided a hurdle for cryptocurrency prices, which mainly consolidated, after a strong start to February. Bitcoin and ethereum were both trading lower during today’s session.
Bitcoin
BTC/USD followed up yesterday’s rally with a weak showing on Wednesday, falling by as much as 1.13% as of writing.
This decline saw prices hit an intraday low of $38,271.44, following a high of $39,115.13 during Tuesday’s market session, which raised hopes for those targeting $40,000.
Today’s move saw BTC’s 14-day RSI once again drop below the resistance level of 40, which it had briefly broken yesterday, hitting its highest price strength since early January in the process.
Recent consolidations in price have meant that the 10-day (red), and 15-day (blue) moving averages have moved closer in proximity, which isn’t a bad thing for bulls.
Looking at the chart, the 10-day is now upward facing, which increases the chances of a potential crossover, and this could be the sign that longer term bulls have been waiting for.
Despite this, we may see markets continue to consolidate prior to this cross.
Ethereum
Ethereum was one of yesterday’s big gainers, breaking out of its resistance level in the process, however those gains have somewhat slowed on Wednesday.
Following yesterday’s breakout, ETH/USD appears to have found a new resistance level of $2,800, which was the level where today’s decline began.
Similar to BTC, this move coincided with the RSI level of 44 acting as a hard ceiling to further gains in strength, leading to prices falling to an intraday low of $2,745.26.
As of writing, ETH/USD is trading marginally lower, falling by 0.41% on the day, with the possibility for a decline back to support of $2,600 also a possibility.
What would need to happen for the recent strength in ETH to continue this week? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

David Marcus, a co-founder of Diem — originally known as Libra — took to Twitter on Tuesday to predict that Bitcoin will be the No. 1 asset in the next two decades.
It’s become clear to me that #Bitcoin will be the one asset and L1 still around in 20+ years with increased compounding relevance over time. The #2 slot (for a different use case) is still tbd. #Ethereum is in the lead for now, but #Solana and others nipping at their heels. 1/2 — David Marcus - dmarcus.eth (@davidmarcus) February 1, 2022
“It’s become clear to me that Bitcoin will be the one asset and L1 still around in 20+ years with increased compounding relevance over time,” Marcus wrote, adding that BTC is “truly leaderless” and “censorship resistant.”
“In essence, it’s unique and cannot ever be replicated,” he added.
Marcus also went on to say that the second-biggest cryptocurrency is yet “to be determined” and will be related to a different use case. He suggested that Ether (ETH) is “in the lead for now,” but other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) are “nipping at their heels.”
Marcus is the former head of Meta’s cryptocurrency and fintech unit, Novi, stepping down from his position in late 2021. He co-founded the Diem stablecoin with Morgan Beller and Kevin Weil.
Despite his hard work on Meta’s stablecoin, Marcus has been a known fan of Bitcoin. According to some industry observers, Marcus is considered “one of the first top Silicon Valley executives to adopt and support Bitcoin.” In 2019, Marcus said that he was a “big fan of Bitcoin,” calling it “digital gold.”

Marcus is not the only Facebook executive who is a fan of Bitcoin. Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg hinted at being a Bitcoin bull in May 2021 by calling his pet goats Max and Bitcoin.

Marcus’ latest remarks came shortly after the Diem Association announced the closure of its digital currency project, Diem, two and a half years after its inception.
Some prominent Bitcoin bulls such as Twitter founder Jack Dorsey subsequently argued that Diem was a waste of time and effort, stressing that the tech giant should have focused on Bitcoin instead."

Here is what several analysts and traders are saying about Wednesday’s Bitcoin price action and what areas to keep an eye on moving forward.
Bulls are in trouble below $36,700
Insight into the major support and resistance zones of note for Bitcoin was provided by crypto trader and pseudonymous Twitter user HornHairs, who posted the following chart indicating a solid level of support near $37,400.

According to the analyst, after finding support at this level, “a move back to $38,000s is just a bearish retest unless we can reclaim $38,700.”
That being said, a bearish move could see the price continue to slide lower with the chart above, indicating that bulls are in trouble below $36,781.
HornHairs said:
“A drop below $36,700 and a move to take out range low seems likely, seeing as we took out the range high yesterday.”
Will the fourth attempt be the charm?

“A fully intact bull market that is consolidating”
A forward-looking analysis on what could come next for Bitcoin was summarized by technical analyst and pseudonymous Twitter user Decodejar, who posted the following chart outlining a possible move lower for the top cryptocurrency.

According to Decodejar, this is a common chart being circulated by analysts, which shows a “bearish ABC wave 4 expanded flat, ending below last year’s lows.”
While this is a common pattern, Decodejar indicated that “there’s not much volume for an impulse,” and they don’t “think we break last year’s lows.”
Decodejar said:
“What this all boils down to is that the correction is likely almost done at these levels, even if the market needs more time. What I do not see is a bear market, in fact, I am sick of hearing it. I see a fully intact bull market that is consolidating.”
The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.729 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 41.1%.

Bloomberg has reported that according to data provided by a tech analyst from Fundstrat headed by Tom Lee, it is likely that Bitcoin may reach the bottom soon.
High chances of Bitcoin bottoming out in a few months
Mark Newton from Fundstrat Global Advisors has told Bloomberg that there is ""a good likelihood"" for Bitcoin to reach a low by spring. He has warned against getting bullish on the flagship coin now, since a new intermediate-term rally has not begun yet and the miner two-week bounce does not mean a rally is coming.
A decline under the $35,500 level would push Bitcoin to testing the $32,950 zone—the low hit by BTC on Jan. 24.
However, if Bitcoin moves above $40,000, which would be crucial for crypto bulls, according to Newton. Until this level is surpassed, Bitcoin is likely to remain in a downward pattern, he believes.

Over the past few weeks, the Bitcoin price has been declining. BTC and Ethereum have begun to show a strong correlation with traditional assets, so conventional investors have begun to jump on the crypto bandwagon too.
At press time, the leading global cryptocurrency is sitting at $36,457, according to data provided by CoinMarketCap.
Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading Inc., is not bullish on Bitcoin in the short-term either, at the moment. According to him, indicators of the crypto derivatives market are neutral but still show a negative trend.
He states that the crypto market is in a wait-and-see mode at the moment.

Another major Bitcoin supporter, President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele, tweeted that he expects a gigantic price increase of BTC to be only a matter of time. The reason for that, according to him, is that there are 50 million millionaires in the world, and one day each of them will want to own at least one Bitcoin. Since there are only 21 million BTC that can exist, this BTC-hunger will push the price through the roof."
77,2022-02-03,2022-02-03,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Joseph P. Laycock,theconversation.com,Why are people calling Bitcoin a religion?,"With mantras, a mysterious founder and promises of societal salvation, there are echoes of religious traditions in the cryptocurrency.",https://theconversation.com/why-are-people-calling-bitcoin-a-religion-175717,"Read enough about Bitcoin, and you’ll inevitably come across people who refer to the cryptocurrency as a religion.
Bloomberg’s Lorcan Roche Kelly called Bitcoin “the first true religion of the 21st century.” Bitcoin promoter Hass McCook has taken to calling himself “The Friar” and wrote a series of Medium pieces comparing Bitcoin to a religion. There is a Church of Bitcoin, founded in 2017, that explicitly calls legendary Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto its “prophet.”
In Austin, Texas, there are billboards with slogans like “Crypto Is Real” that weirdly mirror the ubiquitous billboards about Jesus found on Texas highways. Like many religions, Bitcoin even has dietary restrictions associated with it.
Religion’s dirty secret
So does Bitcoin’s having prophets, evangelists and dietary laws make it a religion or not?
As a scholar of religion, I think this is the wrong question to ask.
The dirty secret of religious studies is that there is no universal definition of what religion is. Traditions such as Christianity, Islam and Buddhism certainly exist and have similarities, but the idea that these are all examples of religion is relatively new.
The word “religion” as it’s used today – a vague category that includes certain cultural ideas and practices related to God, the afterlife or morality – arose in Europe around the 16th century. Before this, many Europeans understood that there were only three types of people in the world: Christians, Jews and heathens.
This model shifted after the Protestant Reformation when a long series of wars began between Catholics and Protestants. These became known as “wars of religion,” and religion became a way of talking about differences between Christians. At the same time, Europeans were encountering other cultures through exploration and colonialism. Some of the traditions they encountered shared certain similarities to Christianity and were also deemed religions.
Non-European languages have historically not had a direct equivalent to the word “religion.” What has counted as religion has changed over the centuries, and there are always political interests at stake in determining whether or not something is a religion.
As religion scholar Russell McCutcheon argues, “The interesting thing to study, then, is not what religion is or is not, but ‘the making of it’ process itself – whether that manufacturing activity takes place in a courtroom or is a claim made by a group about their own behaviors and institutions.”
Critics highlight irrationality
With this in mind, why would anyone claim that Bitcoin is a religion?
Some commentators seem to be making this claim to steer investors away from Bitcoin. Emerging market fund manager Mark Mobius, in an attempt to tamp down enthusiasm about cryptocurrency, said that “crypto is a religion, not an investment.”
His statement, however, is an example of a false dichotomy fallacy, or the assumption that if something is one thing, it cannot be another. There is no reason that a religion cannot also be an investment, a political system or nearly anything else.
Mobius’ point, though, is that “religion,” like cryptocurrency, is irrational. This criticism of religion has been around since the Enlightenment, when Voltaire wrote, “Nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense.”
In this case, labeling Bitcoin a “religion” suggests that bitcoin investors are fanatics and not making rational choices.
Bitcoin as good and wholesome
On the other hand, some Bitcoin proponents have leaned into the religion label. McCook’s articles use the language of religion to highlight certain aspects of Bitcoin culture and to normalize them.
For example, “stacking sats” – the practice of regularly buying small fractions of bitcoins – sounds weird. But McCook refers to this practice as a religious ritual, and more specifically as “tithing.” Many churches practice tithing, in which members make regular donations to support their church. So this comparison makes sat stacking seem more familiar.
While for some people religion may be associated with the irrational, it is also associated with what religion scholar Doug Cowan calls “the good, moral and decent fallacy.” That is, some people often assume if something is really a religion, it must represent something good. People who “stack sats” might sound weird. But people who “tithe” could sound principled and wholesome.
Using religion as a framework
For religion scholars, categorizing something as a religion can pave the way for new insights.
As religion scholar J.Z. Smith writes, “‘Religion’ is not a native term; it is created by scholars for their intellectual purposes and therefore is theirs to define.” For Smith, categorizing certain traditions or cultural institutions as religions creates a comparative framework that will hopefully result in some new understanding. With this in mind, comparing Bitcoin to a tradition like Christianity may cause people to notice things that they didn’t before.
For example, many religions were founded by charismatic leaders. Charismatic authority does not come from any government office or tradition but solely from the relationship between a leader and their followers. Charismatic leaders are seen by their followers as superhuman or at least extraordinary. Because this relationship is precarious, leaders often remain aloof to keep followers from seeing them as ordinary human beings.
Several commentators have noted that Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto resembles a sort of prophet. Nakamoto’s true identity – or whether Nakamoto is actually a team of people – remains a mystery. But the intrigue surrounding this figure is a source of charisma with consequences for bitcoin’s economic value. Many who invest in bitcoin do so in part because they regard Nakamoto as a genius and an economic rebel. In Budapest, artists even erected a bronze statue as a tribute to Nakamoto.
There’s also a connection between Bitcoin and millennialism, or the belief in a coming collective salvation for a select group of people.
In Christianity, millennial expectations involve the return of Jesus and the final judgment of the living and the dead. Some Bitcoiners believe in an inevitable coming “hyperbitcoinization” in which bitcoin will be the only valid currency. When this happens, the “Bitcoin believers” who invested will be justified, while the “no coiners” who shunned cryptocurrency will lose everything.
A path to salvation
Finally, some Bitcoiners view bitcoin as not just a way to make money, but as the answer to all of humanity’s problems.
“Because the root cause of all of our problems is basically money printing and capital misallocation as a result of that,” McCook argues, “the only way the whales are going to be saved, or the trees are going to be saved, or the kids are going to be saved, is if we just stop the degeneracy.”

This attitude may be the most significant point of comparison with religious traditions. In his book “God Is Not One,” religion professor Stephen Prothero highlights the distinctiveness of world religions using a four-point model, in which each tradition identifies a unique problem with the human condition, posits a solution, offers specific practices to achieve the solution and puts forth exemplars to model that path.
This model can be applied to Bitcoin: The problem is fiat currency, the solution is Bitcoin, and the practices include encouraging others to invest, “stacking sats” and “hodling” – refusing to sell bitcoin to keep its value up. The exemplars include Satoshi and other figures involved in the creation of blockchain technology.
So does this comparison prove that Bitcoin is a religion?
Not necessarily, because theologians, sociologists and legal theorists have many different definitions of religion, all of which are more or less useful depending on what the definition is being used for.
However, this comparison may help people understand why Bitcoin has become so attractive to so many people, in ways that would not be possible if Bitcoin were approached as a purely economic phenomenon."
78,2022-02-03,2022-02-03,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Marcel Pechman,cointelegraph.com,Bitcoin bulls may ignore Friday’s $730M options expiry by saving their energy for $40K,"Bitcoin price is no longer in reach of $40,000, but data shows bulls are willing to take a few short-term losses in order to strengthen their next run at the key resistance level.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-may-ignore-friday-s-730m-options-expiry-by-saving-their-energy-for-40k,"The past few months have been less than pleasant for Bitcoin (BTC) bulls, but they are not alone. Persistent comments from the United States Federal Reserve hint at plans to raise interest rates in 2022, which is causing investors to seek protection in inflation-protected bonds.
The monetary authority signaled its intention to substantially raise the benchmark interest rate, and it will also gradually reduce the monthly purchase of debt assets.
Even though some crypto investors deem Bitcoin digital scarcity as inflationary protection, that does not change its volatility. In turn, it causes the asset’s price to move in tandem with risk markets.
Bitcoin price at Coinbase, USD (right) vs. Russell 2000 index (left)
The above chart shows Bitcoin’s price in blue stacked against the smaller U.S. listed companies, as measured by the Russell 2000 equity markets index. Unlike the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Index, this benchmark excludes those tech giants. Thus, the smaller companies are usually considered riskier and are more impacted when investors fear an economic downturn.
However, the negative performance did not scare investors as the Canada-based Purpose Bitcoin ETF attracted over $38 million worth of Bitcoin this Tuesday, its third-largest daily inflow to date. The fund now holds 31,032 BTC, equivalent to $1.2 billion.
Regardless of investors’ sentiment, Bitcoin bulls could face a $120-million loss if BTC’s price moves below $36,000 on Friday’s options expiry.
$730 million in options expire on Feb. 4
According to Friday’s options expiry open interest, Bitcoin bulls placed heavy bets between $40,000 and $44,000. These levels might seem optimistic right now, but Bitcoin was trading above $42,000 two weeks ago.
Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for Feb. 4. Source: Coinglass
At first sight, the $430-million call (buy) options dominate the $300-million put (sell) instruments, but the 1.43 call-to-put ratio does not really tell the whole story. For example, the 14% price drop over the past two weeks wiped out most bullish bets.
A call option gives the buyer a right to buy BTC at a fixed price at 8:00 am UTC on Feb. 4. However, if the market is trading below that price, there is no value in holding that derivative contract, so its value goes to zero.
Therefore, if Bitcoin remains below $37,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Feb. 4, only $34 million of those call (buy) options will be available at the expiry.
Bears will fight to keep Bitcoin below $37,000
Here are the three likeliest scenarios for Friday’s options expiry. The imbalance favoring each side represents the theoretical profit. In other words, depending on the expiry price, the active quantity of call (buy) and put (sell) contracts varies:
Between $35,000 and $37,000: 950 calls vs. 4,210 puts. The net result is $120 million favoring the put (bear) instruments.
950 calls vs. 4,210 puts. The net result is $120 million favoring the put (bear) instruments. Between $37,000 and $38,000: 1,650 calls vs. 3,300 puts. The net result favors bear instruments by $60 million.
1,650 calls vs. 3,300 puts. The net result favors bear instruments by $60 million. Between $38,000 and $39,000: 4,230 calls vs. 1,710 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put options.
This crude estimate considers call options used in bullish bets and put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. However, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.
Bulls need $38,000 to balance the scales
A mere 3% price pump from the current $36,900 level is enough for Bitcoin bulls to avoid a $120-million loss on the Feb. 4 options expiry. Still, the same rationale applies to Bitcoin bears because pinning BTC below $37,000 can easily cause them to secure a $120-million profit.
Considering the short-term negative sentiment caused by tighter macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin bulls should pace their energy for a sustainable recovery to $40,000 and higher instead of wasting efforts right now. Therefore, options markets data slightly favor the put (sell) options.

But with Bitcoin slumping by nearly half since hitting a November high under $69,000 in the midst of crypto's grim winter, the strategy is not without risk — especially for companies bound by strict corporate accounting rules that some argue are in need of updating.
It can also put pressure on the results of firms with crypto on their balance sheets, like Microstrategy — a business intelligence firm turned publicly-traded Bitcoin whale, and make accounting more difficult.
Although crypto is back on the rise, for now at least, some observers argue the whipsawing and accounting rules can make valuing cryptocurrencies more onerous for companies and investors, and may dissuade other firms from getting direct exposure to crypto.
“You can only mark [Bitcoin] down, you can never mark it up, and in truth I’d be better off, from an accounting point of view, to buy a stack of comic books or baseball cards,” Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor told Yahoo Finance last week.

Based on Generally Accepted Accounting Rules (GAAP) and Securities and Exchanges Commission guidance, digital assets must be recorded as indefinite intangible assets. That means they must be marked down for impairment losses but cannot be marked up for value gains, until the asset is sold.
Given crypto volatility, there can be wide swings between the carrying value of Bitcoin and its market value for the same period. For Microstrategy, that equated to a whopping $1.6 billion difference in June, according to the company, which has only gotten worse.
As of this week, Microstrategy owns a total of 125,000 Bitcoins, In the company’s fourth quarter earnings, $110.5 million in gross profit got wiped out by a $147 million impairment loss from holding BTC. Given Bitcoin’s rough start to 2022, the next quarter isn’t expected to look much better.

But while it reported a carrying value of $2.85 billion in BTC for the last period, its same bitcoin holdings were worth $5.7 billion at market value.
A battle brews over accounting rules

Arcane accounting rules are far from the only reason why corporates holding crypto haven’t had a great couple of months. Yet the policy is a barrier to more firms dipping into digital coin.
Industry participants have recognized the problem. Between the summer and early fall, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) - the standard setting body for corporate accounting and GAAP guardian, received hundreds of letters from companies — including Microstrategy and Coinbase (COIN) — asking the organization to consider revising its accounting rules for digital assets.
Robert Sledge, a partner with the accounting firm KPMG who specializes in auditing and other financial services for crypto-focused companies, is among those in favor of a revising the accounting rule. In an interview with Yahoo Finance last fall, Sledge pointed to a letter KPMG filed about the rule, explaining that the current accounting standard may hide important financial information about a company’s value.
Sledge suggested that the most ""meaningful change"" FASB could quickly implement would be to permit digital assets with a readily determinable fair value (market price) to be measured by their fair value. At a later point, FASB could also address broader issues around whether fair value should be applied more widely to certain types of assets and business models.
The organization's decision about whether to change Bitcoin accounting rules is expected to be a slow moving process. For instance, BTC is considered a commodity in the U.S., and changing its accounting rules may potentially change how other certain commodities, such as gold, are recorded.
“Historically, these projects take months to years sometimes,” Sledge added.
On December 15, the FASB added a digital asset project to its research agenda that explores accounting and disclosure of exchange traded digital assets and commodities. In the coming months, it will discuss the research project at a public meeting on a date not yet determined, according to a FASB spokesperson.
“Clearly it would be better if there were fair value accounting for a publicly traded company. If we ever see a transition from indefinite intangible to fair value accounting, that would be a catalyst for more corporate adoption of Bitcoin,” Microstrategy's Saylor added.

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has declared his bitcoin purchase worth up to $50,000. “I’m also particularly proud that my home state, Texas, is becoming an oasis for the blockchain community, for bitcoin miners, for innovators and entrepreneurs in the crypto world,” said the senator.
Senator Ted Cruz Declares Bitcoin Purchase
U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has bought the bitcoin dip. A Periodic Transaction Report filed on Friday shows that the senator from Texas personally bought bitcoin worth between $15,001 and $50,000 on Jan 25.
On the date of the transaction, the price of bitcoin was hovering around $37,000 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.
At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin is $41,708. BTC is up 10.5% over the past seven days but down 4.2% over the last 30 days.
The senator from Texas has long been a vocal bitcoin proponent. In June last year, he said that people are flocking to BTC because the U.S. is on the verge of an inflation crisis.
In November last year, he introduced a resolution for cryptocurrency to be accepted at “restaurants, vending machines, and gift shops in the Capitol Complex.”
Senator Cruz also said: “Cryptocurrency and bitcoin mining provide enormous opportunities. They are creating a vast amount of wealth. They are creating a hedge for people against inflation, inflation is a growing concern across the country. They are creating entrepreneurs in all 50 states.”
He added: “I’m also particularly proud that my home state, Texas, is becoming an oasis for the blockchain community, for bitcoin miners, for innovators and entrepreneurs in the crypto world.”
However, he warned: “Unfortunately, the one thing that’s capable of screwing this all up is the United States Congress.” Cruz has also raised concerns that most Congress members do not understand what Bitcoin is but they are trying to regulate it anyway.
Several U.S. lawmakers have disclosed that they own cryptocurrency, including the pro-bitcoin senator from Wyoming, Cynthia Lummis. Recently, Senator Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania also said he has exposure to cryptocurrency in his portfolio. He believes that crypto is here to stay and diversified portfolios should have some.

Independent storage and security systems meant to hold large quantities of crypto on behalf of clients can bring in institutional capital and retail investors waiting on the sidelines simply because they remove a major fear: losing access to funds that become unrecoverable.
Because of the decentralized nature of major blockchains like that of Bitcoin or Ethereum, whenever a user loses access to their wallet and doesn’t have a backup of their private keys, the funds within it cannot be recovered. There’s no central entity to turn to, and no one can control the blockchain to give anyone access back to their funds.
Storing a private key can be challenging, as it needs to be kept away from bad actors, yet close enough for the user to access it when necessary. Dealing with the challenges associated with managing cryptocurrency has seen many simply leave their funds on cryptocurrency exchanges, creating a massive demand for crypto custody services, to the point where America’s fifth-largest bank is offering a solution.
While keeping cryptocurrencies with a third party is often seen as a security risk because that third party can itself get hacked, experts told Cointelegraph that custody services are the best option out there when it comes to lost coins.
Early cryptocurrency adopters have lost cryptocurrency in numerous ways, including exchange hacks. These security breaches have seen Bitcoin academic Andreas Antonopoulos popularize the famous slogan “not your keys, not your coins.”
How much crypto has been lost?
Cryptocurrencies can be lost in a number of ways, although unless someone admits that they have lost access to their funds, it’s impossible to tell from data on the blockchain. More often than not, users lose access to a wallet’s private key, which allows them to access the funds within it.
There have also been cases in which users send cryptocurrency to the wrong address. Once again, because of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, there’s no remedial action to retrieve these tokens. Finally, users can pass away without leaving anyone else access to their funds.
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Kim Grauer, director of research at blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, noted that an estimated 3.7 million Bitcoin (BTC) (today worth over $140 billion) has been lost. Grauer said the estimate is a “bit old” and is set to be updated with further research later this year.
Crypto assets are often considered lost after remaining dormant for a specific number of years. While this method does point to coins that are effectively not currently in circulation, it is flawed. In 2020, for example, a wallet with 50 BTC first mined in February 2009 moved its funds to two addresses.
Michael Fasanello, director of training and regulatory affairs at the Blockchain Intelligence Group — which helps government agencies, cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions address fraud — told Cointelegraph it may be difficult to approximate the monetary value of lost coins because “those who suffered losses would not always be interested in sharing such information.”
The figure of 3.7 million represents close to 20% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, which, to Grauer, likely has an “economic impact that will affect the long-term price” of the cryptocurrency. Grauer added:
“There is also a more psychological impact. It’s possible people will be more hesitant to invest in Bitcoin out of a fear of losing it, at which point it is not recoverable.”
The Chainalysis executive added that this quality isn’t unique to the cryptocurrency ecosystem and “should not be prohibitive to further adoption,” as there are “many ways to custody your cryptocurrency safely either in your own possession or on an exchange.”
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Chris Brooks, founder of cryptocurrency recovery business Crypto Asset Recovery, noted that in his experience, people should be more worried about leaving their seed phrase or private keys in paper wallets that can be mistakenly thrown out, rather than about hackers or scammers. Brooks said:
“You have a far greater chance of moving to a new apartment and losing your crypto password in the process than you do of getting hacked.”
In March 2011, a user on the Bitcointalk forum started a thread, trying to add up the known lost BTC. While the thread derailed with time, it did show just how many users have lost access to cryptocurrency over the years.
These losses, as Chainalysis’ Grauer said, can have a significant economic impact on the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Should lost crypto be considered a donation?
Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto has famously said that lost coins “only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more” and that they should be thought of as a “donation to everyone.” The Blockchain Intelligence Group’s Fasanello said that when it comes to coins with a limited supply, Satoshi may be right, but those with an infinite supply could see the reverse be true.
Fasanello said that just as fiat currency loses value with inflation, so do cryptocurrencies. If a cryptocurrency doesn’t have a finite supply, the value of the lost coins is simply going to erode over time.
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Yuriy Kovalev, CEO of crypto trading platform Zenfuse, said that lost coins represent a hidden cost of security in the cryptocurrency space that benefits everyone else:
“The amount of lost crypto only shows that decentralized networks like Bitcoin are extremely secure, so much so that trivial mistakes can cost millions. Wallet hunters are seldom only able to help in cases of lost passwords, further proving the blockchain is immutable.”
Indeed, most cases in which lost tokens are recovered involve lost passwords used to unlock wallets and not the private keys used to recover them. A recent case saw a computer engineer and hardware hacker crack a Trezor One hardware wallet that was locked because its owner had forgotten its security PIN.
Asaf Naim, founder and CEO of blockchain application developer Kirobo, told Cointelegraph that Satoshi’s words may be true for “minor and occasional instances of losing crypto,” but Naim added that the “law of scarcity only holds if people have confidence in the underlying system. If too much cryptocurrency is lost, people will stop believing in its use and its intrinsic value.”
Lost crypto and mass adoption
Early stories from the cryptocurrency space about lost crypto have made headlines over the years, pointing to how hard it may be to recover lost funds. One such example is that of James Howells, who threw away a hard drive containing 7,500 BTC (almost $285 million today) while cleaning his house in 2013.
Wallet recovery services have gained popularity over the last few years but often charge large percentages of the funds they recover. Grauer said that there are industry solutions meant to reduce the chances of accidental losses, which include “storing your cryptocurrency on a known and trusted exchange, or hot wallet, similar to what you do with a bank.”
The approach contrasts those who argue that if a user does not control the private keys to their wallet, they do not actually own the coins within it. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Crypto Asset Recovery’s Brooks seemed to agree with Grauer, adding, however, that “crypto can be extremely complicated,” and as such, he believes “new investors are better off with custodial wallets.”
To Brooks, if a user suddenly passes away or suffers a serious accident, it’s easy for loved ones to claim their crypto from a custodial wallet, but it’s hard to do so through the use of a private key. Kirobo’s Naim believes the cryptocurrency recovery industry may be important but is part of a backward approach:
“The main effect of so much crypto being lost is that it stands in the way of mass adoption. If people don’t feel safe using crypto, they just won’t use it. It’s not acceptable that forgetting access credentials is irreversible.”
He added that credit cards wouldn’t be as popular as they are if “there was a high chance of irreversibly losing money every time you used one.” The solution could be related to cryptocurrency platforms and their user experience, which could, for example, implement whitelists the same way online banking platforms do to prevent common errors.
To the executive, it’s “amazing that writing down words on a piece of paper or memorizing them is the best practice for security in 2022,” as it shows “crypto has lacked a safety net for human error.”
The free market has attempted to come up with better solutions over time, which include the creation of titanium sheets where users can write down their seed phrases or private keys. These sheets are harder to throw away by accident and can often survive natural disasters. Some wallets, including Coinbase Wallet, allow users to back up their private keys on Google Drive or iCloud.
While cryptocurrency custody services may offer institutional investors the security they need to enter the market, for users looking for an uncensorable form of money, lost crypto may continue to be a problem for the foreseeable future."

Bitcoin should flip $41,000 to support
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed a mercifully non-volatile weekend for BTC/USD, which continued to test $42,000 resistance while retaining $40,000 as support.
Friday’s unexpected gap upward initially resulted in misgivings over a price “fakeout,” but at the time of writing, no significant retracement had entered.
“I do not believe this Bitcoin impulse is done,” popular trader and analyst TechDev announced.
Other comments focused on what could be a more sustainable price transformation, with William Clemente eyeing $41,000 as a support-resistance flip to secure an attack on levels closer to $50,000 next.
“Pretty straightforward price action-wise for BTC,” he tweeted in fresh analysis on the day.
“Bidding green box(es); would like to see a higher low set for continuation. Flip the 40-41k area as support and can start eyeing 47K which is PoB in confluence with yearly open and STH realized price. Final major area is 58k.”

It’s been a wild start of the year for crypto. Anyone with a Coinbase account has been getting notifications on their phones: Bitcoin up 5% on Monday. Bitcoin down 6% on Tuesday. Anyone who thought that the cryptocurrency markets would not correlate with traditional markets is having their assumptions challenged. It looks like Bitcoin is tracking the Nasdaq, which means big investors are making the same moves: sell Facebook, sell Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency investors want something other than a double leveraged QQQ. This is supposed to be a whole new world. What is happening with these correlations?
Over the last month, Bitcoin is down 12.9% against the dollar. The Invesco Nasdaq ETF (QQQ) is down 10%. Bitcoin looks like a slightly more beta version of the QQQ.
“There is a higher correlation today than there was six months ago,” says Martin Green, co-founder and CEO of Cambrian Asset Management.
Over the last three years, the Bitcoin-Nasdaq correlation was .2 but “in the last several weeks, I’d say it has doubled to around point four,” Green says.
Correlations aren’t always the perfect guidepost of a market’s direction.
“Lots of people look at correlations as if it is a great number in and of itself, but what is really important is that there are times when things are very highly correlated, and there are times when they are not; and there are times when they are correlated when the market is going up, or only when prices are going down,” says Green. “I would say that recently along the two axis – up and down – Bitcoin and tech stocks are in tandem because of interest rates and inflation concerns that have affected stocks and crypto.""
Bitcoin and the Nasdaq were neck and neck for much of 2019. Bitcoin pulled away hard in 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, as investors assumed a market crash and were looking elsewhere to put their money.
Over the last two years, Bitcoin is up 320% to the Nasdaq’s respectable 56%.
“Crypto was originally intended to be a separate decentralized environment, independent of traditional markets. Things have changed considerably since then,” says Mike Ermolaev, a spokesman for ChangeNOW, a five-year-old Seychelles-based cryptocurrency company whose core product is an exchange platform trading over 380 digital assets and 60 fiat currencies.
The fast adoption of Bitcoin among companies and institutions could add to it being treated by those money managers like a Facebook and Google stock.
“There has been a lot of money flowing into crypto from traditional markets these past couple years,” says Ermolaev. “During that time, traditional markets and cryptocurrency markets have converged. It’s evident from various indicators that tech stocks and Bitcoin are strongly correlated right now.”
That means the same factors that send tech stocks lower, like monetary policy, rising inflation, and weakening demand for some key tech product lines — like Facebook recently — can weigh on sentiment for crypto. It's a risk-off sentiment across the board.
The recent sell-off in the market — both for Bitcoin, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500, has brought out the usual bear market pundits. The end is always near.
Still, the good news for retail cryptocurrency investors is that while Bitcoin tracks the market over a short period of time, the crypto investing market is becoming more mature. Investors are becoming smarter and thinking longer term. These institutional investors, and retail ‘hodlers’ (that’s not a typo) are less likely to trade crypto like they’re in a Macau casino.
Some in the industry think crypto investing can be safer than tech stocks. It all depends on the investment.
“The top crypto projects, such as the top 100 by market cap, aren’t much different than traditional stocks in terms of risk,” says Elvin Aziyev, CEO and co-founder of Dubai-based Metafluence, a start-up that gives social media influencers a chance to monetize their popularity in the metaverse — a new type of virtual reality currently in its nascent stage.
Aziyev said the recent sell-off affected their product launch and trading volume.
“This resembles the early 2018 sell-off a bit,” Aziyev says, adding that he’s not worried about the ups and downs of Bitcoin pricing. “I don’t think it’s going to follow the same path this time.”
The bears would say it can only get worse.
Who’s buying that line?
QQQ x BTC over a five week trading period and over a 12 month period. Not paid much for the ... [+] volatility. KMR Images
Buy Now? Pay Later?
Never catch a falling knife. Every investor knows that old adage.
“We have probably around 200 investors across numerous vehicles and we have not had one email or call from any of them asking about the crypto volatility or about how the fund is doing. Not one,” says Green.
Retail investors may want to take a more wait-and-see approach, build up cash, and then buy more discounted Bitcoin. It seems the recent sell-off has bottomed out, and Bitcoin, like the Nasdaq, is in a holding pattern. Where it goes from here is anybody’s guess.
“I am definitely not nervous,” says Sheraz Ahmed, Managing Partner of STORM Partners, a blockchain solutions provider based in in Montreux, Switzerland. “Every sell off is different, although this one might be particularly distinct due to the levels of global adoption that we have seen before.”
The role played by institutional investors — whether it’s Tesla or Goldman Sachs — coupled with the selling appetite of Bitcoin whales matters here. If the two sides are going to think the same, then Bitcoin will be nothing more than a riskier Nasdaq, only good for the cash rich who can stomach deep declines and treat them as buying opportunities.
For the retail investor with a few hundred dollars in cash to be deployed, it’s a demotivator. Buying Bitcoin becomes like learning to invest in energy and tech stocks at a time when Enron is going bust, California energy deregulation is killing Calpine shares, and WorldCom vanishes as a going concern. These are all real risks the retail investor faces in steep downturns of Bitcoin. And right now, Bitcoin is down over 30% from it’s all-time highs. That’s a bear market at the moment for Bitcoin.
All of this can change in a day. And we have been here before with Bitcoin.
“I have been in crypto for a long time. For those of us truly old crypto investors and builders who lived through 2017, nothing will ever be similar to that,” says Leah Allegra, CEO and founder of RugDoc, a U.S. based platform for decentralized finance education, security, and yield strategies. She’s invested in yield-bearing crypto.
“Investors are willing to ride this out,” she says. “When Bitcoin dropped down to $29,000 in July and when it recently dropped down to $35,000, I didn’t see mass panic, I saw investors...looking for openings in the market that they could profit from in the meantime, such as switching from NFT trading to yield farming.”

Worth noting about the slide, says Ermolaev in Seychelles, investor attention has also been diverted by energy concerns over Bitcoin mining which has had investors shifting into buying new blockchain protocols. The growth of the metaverse and decentralized finance sectors have also shifted demand slightly.
“Long-term crypto investors seem unfazed,” Ermolaev says about the Bitcoin bear market. “They plan to keep holding for the long haul. For me, the red flag support level for BTC is $30,000.”
Since Bitcoin began, there has been around 80% drawdowns and multiple 50% drawdowns. It recently went through another 50% drawdown since November. Bitcoin investor rival, Ethereum (ETH), went through a 50% drawdown in May 2021.
“This is the nature of investing in a very early-stage asset class,” says Green from Cambrian Asset Management. They run a quantitative fund for cryptocurrencies, trading around 68 different digital assets.
“A year ago, we only invested in 18 different digital assets,” Green says. About Bitcoin: “It’s going to be very volatile. When these drawdowns happen, don’t be a panic seller. If there’s no risk, there’s no return.”

85,2022-02-08,2022-02-08,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,www.justice.gov,Two Arrested for Alleged Conspiracy to Launder $4.5 Billion in Stolen Cryptocurrency,,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency,"View Deputy Attorney General Monaco's Remarks here.
Two individuals were arrested this morning in Manhattan for an alleged conspiracy to launder cryptocurrency that was stolen during the 2016 hack of Bitfinex, a virtual currency exchange, presently valued at approximately $4.5 billion. Thus far, law enforcement has seized over $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency linked to that hack.
“Today’s arrests, and the department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “In a futile effort to maintain digital anonymity, the defendants laundered stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions. Thanks to the meticulous work of law enforcement, the department once again showed how it can and will follow the money, no matter what form it takes.”
“Today, federal law enforcement demonstrates once again that we can follow money through the blockchain, and that we will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The arrests today show that we will take a firm stand against those who allegedly try to use virtual currencies for criminal purposes.”
Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, both of New York, New York, are scheduled to make their initial appearances in federal court today at 3:00 p.m. in Manhattan.
According to court documents, Lichtenstein and Morgan allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin that were stolen from Bitfinex’s platform after a hacker breached Bitfinex’s systems and initiated more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions. Those unauthorized transactions sent the stolen bitcoin to a digital wallet under Lichtenstein’s control. Over the last five years, approximately 25,000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein’s wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan. The remainder of the stolen funds, comprising more than 94,000 bitcoin, remained in the wallet used to receive and store the illegal proceeds from the hack. After the execution of court-authorized search warrants of online accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan, special agents obtained access to files within an online account controlled by Lichtenstein. Those files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet that directly received the funds stolen from Bitfinex, and allowed special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94,000 bitcoin that had been stolen from Bitfinex. The recovered bitcoin was valued at over $3.6 billion at the time of seizure.
“Cryptocurrency and the virtual currency exchanges trading in it comprise an expanding part of the U.S. financial system, but digital currency heists executed through complex money laundering schemes could undermine confidence in cryptocurrency,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. “The Department of Justice and our office stand ready to confront these threats by using 21st century investigative techniques to recover the stolen funds and to hold the perpetrators accountable.”
The criminal complaint alleges that Lichtenstein and Morgan employed numerous sophisticated laundering techniques, including using fictitious identities to set up online accounts; utilizing computer programs to automate transactions, a laundering technique that allows for many transactions to take place in a short period of time; depositing the stolen funds into accounts at a variety of virtual currency exchanges and darknet markets and then withdrawing the funds, which obfuscates the trail of the transaction history by breaking up the fund flow; converting bitcoin to other forms of virtual currency, including anonymity-enhanced virtual currency (AEC), in a practice known as “chain hopping”; and using U.S.-based business accounts to legitimize their banking activity.
“In a methodical and calculated scheme, the defendants allegedly laundered and disguised their vast fortune,” said Chief Jim Lee of IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). “IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit special agents have once again unraveled a sophisticated laundering technique, enabling them to trace, access and seize the stolen funds, which has amounted to the largest cryptocurrency seizure to date, valued at more than $3.6 billion.”
“Criminals always leave tracks, and today’s case is a reminder that the FBI has the tools to follow the digital trail, wherever it may lead,” said FBI Deputy Director Paul M. Abbate. “Thanks to the persistent and dedicated work of our FBI Investigative teams and law enforcement partners, we're able to uncover the source of even the most sophisticated schemes and bring justice to those who try to exploit the security of our financial infrastructure.”
“Financial crime strikes at the core of our national and economic security. With a hack of this magnitude, public and private sector collaboration is crucial to ensure continued consumer confidence in our financial system,” said Acting Executive Associate Director Steve Francis of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). “Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan attempted to subvert legitimate commerce for their own nefarious purposes, operating with perceived anonymity. Today’s action demonstrates HSI’s commitment and ability to work with a collation of the willing to unravel these technical fraud schemes and identify the perpetrators, regardless of where they operate.”
Lichtenstein and Morgan are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to defraud the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The investigation was led by IRS-CI Washington, D.C. Field Office’s Cyber Crimes Unit, the FBI’s Chicago Field Office, and HSI-New York. The Ansbach Police Department in Germany provided assistance during this investigation.
The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Jessica Peck and C. Alden Pelker of the Justice Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher B. Brown of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Paralegal Specialists Angela De Falco and Brian Rickers and Legal Assistant Jessica McCormick provided valuable assistance. Significant assistance was also provided by Trial Attorney Christen Gallagher of the Office of International Affairs, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and Southern District of New York, HSI-Philadelphia, and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica C. Brooks.
A complaint is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."

The seizure — the largest ever for the department — and arrests stem from the 2016 breach of the Bitfinex exchange. At the time of the hack, the stolen funds were worth around $71 million, but the value has since soared to around $4.5 billion, officials said.
On Tuesday morning, federal agents in New York arrested Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, in Manhattan. The couple faces charges of money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States.
""Today's arrests, and the department's largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.
The case revolves around the 2016 cyber breach of Bitfinex, during which the hacker stole some 120,000 bitcoin and transferred them to a digital wallet —akin to a virtual account — outside the exchange.
Prosecutors say that digital wallet was under Lichtenstein's control. Court papers say he and Morgan then conspired to launder those funds, conducting a series of small, complex transactions across digital platforms to try to hide the money.
But, court papers say, investigators managed to trace the stolen funds through thousands of transactions to over a dozen accounts held in the name of Lichtenstein, Morgan or their businesses. Prosecutors say the couple also set up accounts with fake names to use in their laundering operation.
Court papers say the couple cashed out the stolen bitcoin into U.S. dollars through bitcoin ATMs and the purchase of gold and non-fungible tokens as well as Walmart gift cards.
The Justice Department has recently boosted its efforts to crack down on crypto crimes and created a national cryptocurrency enforcement team last fall to focus on sophisticated cryptocurrency crimes."

Therefore, more traders are looking for platforms where they can buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies to make profits. In this case, Bitcoin Motion is one of those websites where traders can buy and sell Bitcoin.
Is Cryptocurrency Trading Profitable?
Cryptocurrency trading is highly profitable because of the high volatility of digital currencies. In this case, with Bitcoin Motion, trades are made by buying and selling Bitcoin, which has high volatility. Therefore, you can easily make profits through cryptocurrency trading.
Moreover, there are short-term speculative interests that make the trading so exciting. The prices can increase rapidly and consistently when the market push and pull factors interact. In such circumstances, cryptocurrency traders get massive profits.
However, it would be best to remember that these investments are also risky. After all, you can also make significant losses if you do not keep track of the changes in the market. Therefore, it is good to invest wisely if you want to get profits comfortably.
What Is Bitcoin Motion?
Bitcoin Motion is a platform with tools and automated features that allow cryptocurrency traders to transact safely. This platform has market data and tech indicators integrated into the system to give traders trading solutions when buying and selling digital currencies.
This platform was founded by a group of cryptocurrency professionals who hold a firm belief that digital currency is the future. They aim to make cryptocurrency trade easy for all traders to encourage more traders to join this platform and trade.
How Bitcoin Motion Works

However, this is not true because even beginners can learn from the information posted on the site, as well as other reputable sources, and make huge profits after trading. Therefore, you can make money if you trade the right way and be aware of the changing market trends. However, because of the high volatility of the cryptocurrency markets, you need to be aware of any market changes that would affect the price and value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.
Is Digital Currency The Future?
Cryptocurrency has been widely misunderstood for years, with many people calling it a scam. Moreover, some people claimed that it is a gamble and a scheme by online fraudsters to get money from unsuspecting Internet users. Unfortunately, these unfounded claims have made some people retract for fear of being scammed.
However, governments and central banks have failed to ensure equal access and security of financial services to the citizens. Therefore, people are slowly resorting to the electronic payment system whose security is guaranteed by cryptography.
The launch of Bitcoin Motion’s website can help affirm that cryptocurrency trading is here to stay. Today, many people are embracing digital currency because it has proved to be legitimate and trustworthy. Therefore, cryptocurrency is the future. So, it’s best to embrace it now and keep up with the changing times.
Conclusion
Bill Gates once said that digital currency is the future of money. This statement can be considered accurate because digital currency is steadily becoming popular. Therefore, the launch of the Bitcoin Motion website is a big step towards the actualisation of the cryptocurrency trade for all traders."
88,2022-02-08,2022-02-08,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Iwa Salami,theconversation.com,"Cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse threaten an environmental nightmare - here’s how to avoid it",Blockchain technology can be made greener if we change the way transactions happen.,https://theconversation.com/cryptocurrency-nfts-and-the-metaverse-threaten-an-environmental-nightmare-heres-how-to-avoid-it-175761,"As concerns rise and hearings are held in the US about the cryptocurrency industry’s effect on the environment, it’s time to address blockchain’s poor sustainability record. The first port of call should be changing how transactions on the blockchain operate – a move which could cut its energy usage by 99.99%.
A cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that, unlike traditional money, isn’t issued by any central bank or agency. Cryptocurrencies are powered by blockchain technology, which allows the exchange of virtual coins like bitcoin and ether.
Cryptocurrency mining is the process of creating new coins by solving complex mathematical problems. The mining process also validates transactions on the cryptocurrency’s network, proving that they’re genuine.
Crypto transactions are validated in two main ways: using either a “proof of work” or “proof of stake” mechanism.
Proof of work requires miners around the world to compete to complete a maths puzzle. The winner is rewarded with a predetermined amount of cryptocurrency and the ability to validate their transaction.
In proof of stake, cryptocurrency owners validate blockchain transactions based on the number of coins they stake. In other words, cryptocurrency owners are required to put up their own cryptocurrency as collateral for the opportunity to successfully approve transactions.
Proof of work is more secure than proof of stake, but it’s slower and consumes more energy. The mining activities of pioneering blockchains like Bitcoin are based on proof of work and thus use enormous amounts of energy. But switching transactions to proof of stake has the potential to dramatically cut emissions.
Although renewable energy is now being used to power some cryptocurrency activities, that energy could surely be put to better use elsewhere: for example, to power homes or businesses. Instead, if blockchain transactions were verified through proof of stake – a move that Ethereum is planning to make – their energy consumption could be reduced to 0.01% of its original value.
Emissions
The estimated power needed to run the Bitcoin network across the world is an extraordinary 7.46 gigawatts (GW) per year. For comparison, in 2020 an average-sized nuclear plant produced around 1GW of electrical power in a year. The energy required for just one bitcoin transaction could power the average US home for more than 70 days.
As the US committee heard, a bitcoin transaction adds around 400kg of CO² to the atmosphere (assuming it’s powered by an energy mix typical of the UK, of which around two-thirds comes from fossil fuel).

Together, Bitcoin and Ethereum mining operations emit more than 70 million tonnes of CO² into the atmosphere. That’s the same as the annual exhaust emissions of over 15.5 million cars. One cryptocurrency mining firm is even seeking to restart operations at two coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania to generate more energy.
Crypto futures
The main concern raised by the US committee was that, given the potential for a dramatic increase in cryptocurrencies’ value, their required energy consumption – and environmental impact – is likely to keep growing.
This is partly thanks to the boom in related markets like decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are largely based on the Ethereum blockchain.
DeFi is a financial system using blockchain technology to let users make transactions and investments without going through a central mediator, while NFTs are unique pieces of digital media stored on the blockchain.
Although DeFi only launched in 2017, its value already hit £85 billion in November 2021. And NFTs’ total sale value grew from £74 million in 2020 to £29.6 billion in 2021.
Also, since NFTs are most commonly created on the Ethereum blockchain – which uses proof of work to verify transactions – it takes a lot of energy to create one. And as NFTs feature prominently in the growing metaverse, their energy demand is only set to increase.

It sounds contradictory, but adopting blockchain technology could actually have a positive effect on the environment over the long term. This is because it could allow companies to automate many of their complex payment systems, reducing the number of commuting employees and resulting in fewer transport-related emissions.
While the extent of this transformation is very hard to predict, it’s becoming clear that as blockchain technology grows, its benefits will too. For example, as developments in blockchain continue to break new ground in business and finance, we’re seeing cryptocurrency accelerate financial inclusion for those who’ve historically been excluded from participating in formal financial systems.
As more businesses enter the metaverse, governments and regulators should aim to ensure that environmental implications are minimised without stifling innovation. Requiring blockchains to adopt proof of stake would be a good start.

As part of the operation, authorities detained a New York couple on allegations they planned to launder the digital goods.
It marks the agency's largest financial seizure ever, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.
Officials said they arrested Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31. The couple is scheduled to make their initial appearances in federal court later in the day. Lichtenstein's and Morgan's legal representation wasn't immediately clear.
Authorities accuse the pair of trying to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin that were stolen from Bitfinex's platform after a hacker breached Bitfinex's systems and initiated more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions. Prosecutors allege that the transactions sent the stolen bitcoin to Lichtenstein's digital wallet.
Officials said they were able to seize more than 94,000 bitcoin, which was valued around $3.6 billion at the time of seizure. In all, the total stolen bitcoin is presently valued at approximately $4.5 billion, according to the agency.
""Today, federal law enforcement demonstrates once again that we can follow money through the blockchain, and that we will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system,"" Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr. said in a statement.
The pair are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to defraud the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
Crypto platforms have faced a number of hacks and scams in recent months. Scammers took home a record $14 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. Most recently, Wormhole, one of the most popular bridges linking the ethereum and solana blockchains, lost about $320 million in an apparent hack earlier this month.

90,2022-02-10,2022-02-10,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Jim Waterson,www.theguardian.com,BBC cryptocurrency documentary pulled from air at last minute,Programme about ‘self-made crypto-millionaire’ dropped amid questions over central claims,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/10/bbc-cryptocurrency-documentary-pulled-from-air-at-last-minute,"The BBC has pulled a documentary about a cryptocurrency entrepreneur from television schedules at the last minute after the Guardian raised questions about some of its central claims.
The programme, called The Crypto-Millionaire and due to be broadcast at 7.30pm on Wednesday night, was to tell the story of Hanad Hassan, a 20-year-old from Birmingham who said he had become incredibly wealthy by trading cryptocurrencies. The programme claimed he had turned a $50 (£37) investment at the start of 2021 into $8m (£5.9m) by the end of the year – suggesting he had made an astonishing investment return of almost 16,000,000% in just nine months.
An accompanying BBC website article entitled “Birmingham’s self-made crypto-millionaire giving back” also displayed Hassan’s £30,000 BMW and his city centre flat, while describing how he “decided he was going to become a millionaire while he was still a teenager”.
The documentary, due to be broadcast on BBC One in the West Midlands, followed Hassan as he distributed money to food banks in Birmingham, supposedly funded by a charitable cryptocurrency he set up himself.
The Guardian asked the BBC if it was confident in his claimed financial returns and questioned why the programme’s promotional material did not mention that Hassan’s cryptocurrency Orfano was abruptly shut down in October, with many unhappy investors claiming they were left out of pocket as a result.
The BBC swiftly said it had withdrawn the show but did not make any further comment on its editorial checks. An accompanying online article, which had featured prominently on the BBC News homepage, was also deleted without explanation shortly after the Guardian raised questions. Hassan has also been approached for comment.
The decision to pull the show from BBC One schedules hours before it was due to be broadcast is embarrassing for the corporation, as it was one of the channel’s headline commissions for its new regional television news show We Are England. This new show replaced the long-running Inside Out regional current affairs series, which was cancelled as part of BBC funding cuts in a decision that resulted in many investigative journalists based outside London losing their jobs.
Continuing cuts to BBC budgets and deep job cuts, caused by successive licence fee freezes, have been blamed for recent errors in the corporation’s news output, especially in regional English newsrooms.
The BBC has a patchy track record of covering cryptocurrencies and publishing stories about young entrepreneurs making large amounts of money from online trading. In October the corporation infamously promoted the rapidly rising price of a cryptocurrency that used the name of the Netflix show Squid Game, days before its price collapsed in an apparent scam.
A BBC Three show about a 20-year-old from Wales who claimed to be making £8,000 a day from online currency trading was also removed from iPlayer in 2020 after the broadcaster accepted it “wasn’t explicit enough about the potential risks involved in forex trading”."
91,2022-02-10,2022-02-10,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Olga Kharif,www.aljazeera.com,Who gets the $3.6BN in Bitcoin US seized in Bitfinex hack?,Figuring out whom the crypto belongs to may not be simple.,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/2/10/who-gets-the-3-6bn-in-bitcoin-us-seized-in-bitfinex-hack,"After the attack in August 2016, when a hacker made away with more than 119,000 Bitcoin, Bitfinex allocated losses of more than 30 percent to all customer accounts.
Who walks away with the $3.6 billion in Bitcoin that the U.S. recovered from the Bitfinex currency exchange hack has become the cryptosphere’s favorite guessing game.
David Silver, a lawyer who specializes in financial and cryptocurrency-related fraud, said since the seizure was announced Tuesday he’s received dozens of calls from individuals saying they lost money in the 2016 online heist and they want to get their coins back. Twitter has been whipped into a frenzy as well, with posters asking how to claim lost crypto. Justice Department officials said they plan to establish a court process for victims to reclaim the stolen digital assets, which have since surged in value.
Figuring out whom the crypto belongs to may not be simple, however. Bitfinex considers that it’s made investors whole, and said in a statement that it will “follow appropriate legal processes to establish our rights to a return of the stolen Bitcoin.” If Bitfinex and users start off on a collision course, the legal battle would likely be protracted.
“The world has changed dramatically since 2016, and everyone is going to lay claim to this newfound bag of Bitcoins,” Silver said.
Bitfinex, a unit of British Virgin Islands registered iFinex Inc., declined comment.
Does this get distributed to the people who were stolen from? — Glenn Mack (@glenn_mcan) February 8, 2022
At the heart of Bitfinex’s argument is a long-ago token distribution. After the attack in August 2016, when a hacker made away with more than 119,000 Bitcoin, Bitfinex allocated losses of more than 30% to all customer accounts. It then created and credited BFX tokens to customers at a ratio of one for every $1 lost. Within eight months, all holders had those tokens redeemed, or had exchanged them for iFinex capital stock. During that time, Bitcoin’s price had nearly doubled, according to Bloomberg data.
Bitfinex also created another coin named Recovery Right Token, or RRT, for holders that had converted their BFX tokens into iFinex shares. In case the stolen Bitcoins were ever recouped, recovered funds would be distributed to RRT holders, at up to $1 per RRT. There are currently 30 million RRT tokens outstanding, according to Bitfinex. That could lead to a reimbursement of up to $30 million.
Bitfinex plans to use a portion of at least 80% of the recovered net funds to buy up and destroy another token called Leo it issued in 2019 to beef up its coffers. The tokens traded at about $6.50 on Thursday after climbing as high as $8 on Feb. 8, according to CoinMarketCap pricing data.
“Bitfinex doesn’t owe me anything, they made me whole years ago,” said Erik Voorhees, an early crypto advocate who runs the ShapeShift cryptocurrency exchange.
Many customers disagree, particularly given Bitcoin’s appreciation from less than $600 in August 2016 to around $44,700. The tokens were worth about $71 million at the time of the hack, with the total amount now valued at about $4.5 billion.
“I think that’s ridiculous,” Alan Aronoff, a 52-year-old San Francisco resident, said in an interview. “That’s my Bitcoin that they took from my multisig wallet. I would like my Bitcoin back.” Aronoff doesn’t remember whether he signed away any rights to his stolen Bitcoin while accepting the Bitfinex reimbursement.
“They can have their equity back,” said Aronoff, who claims to own about $50,000 of “illiquid” Bitfinex stock. “I’ll take my Bitcoin, thank you very much.”
Much will depend on what the user agreement Bitfinex had people sign in 2016 said, said Kyle Roche, of Roche Freedman LLP, which is involved in litigation against Bitfinex. He’s already fielded inquiries from about 10 people about how to claim funds.
Another difficulty may lie even in verifying customer identities. Even today, anyone with an email address can simply open an account on Bitfinex, without any further verification for most basic functions.
“I don’t believe DoJ will turn $3.6 billion to an organization that can’t identify who this Bitcoin belongs to,” Silver said. iFinex had previously settled with the New York Attorney General over false claims related to its Tether product, the world’s most popular stablecoin.
Many observers point out that creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox are still waiting to receive reimbursements under a plan that became final and binding in November. Mt. Gox closed in early 2014 after losing the coins of thousands of customers.
Who hacked the Bitfinex is still unclear as well, and could be pertinent to any distribution, Silver said. The married couple who were arrested on Feb. 8 were accused of money laundering, not stealing the coins.
Assuming the couple enters a guilty plea, the criminal process could take a year to play out, said Kellen Dwyer, former assistant U.S. Attorney who is now an Alston & Bird partner and co-leader of the firm’s national security and digital crimes team. The determination of who is entitled to restitution and how much could take years, he said.
“That process could take the heck of a long time,” Dwyer said. “It certainly could be multiple years before anybody sees any cash.”"

Subscribe for a weekly guide to the future of the Internet. You can find past issues of the newsletter here.
It’s the biggest financial seizure in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice: $3.6 billion in Bitcoin that the government says was stolen in a massive hack in 2016.
The announcement on Tuesday by federal law enforcement and prosecutors revealed a six-year chess match to find the culprits behind the theft of 119,754 Bitcoin from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. The proceeds—worth $72 million then, but $4.5 billion now—were siphoned from users’ accounts into a single crypto wallet.
For years, most of the money sat in that wallet untouched. But, once the currency slowly began to move out of the wallet and into the traditional banking system, investigators were able to start tracing the transactions to people in the real world. On Tuesday, a married couple in New York, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, age 34 and 31, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States.
The anatomy of Lichtenstein and Morgan’s alleged money laundering scheme—and how they got caught—is a cautionary tale in an era of rapid blockchain ascendancy. To get better insight into what happened, TIME spoke with two crypto security experts: Ari Redbord, the head of legal and government affairs at TRM Labs, a cryptocurrency regulatory startup; and Tom Robinson, a co-founder of the Blockchain analytics company Elliptic. Together, along with details in government affidavits they paint a picture of a crypto-savvy couple trying to stay one step ahead of the law and constant advances in blockchain tracking and security. Eventually, the painstaking detective work of government officials, and the innate transparency of the blockchain and its lack of red tape led to the arrests. “The problem with laundering cryptocurrency is if you make a mistake five years ago, that’s still on the blockchain for everyone to see,” Robinson says.
The hack
In the mid-2010s, Bitcoin became a tool for drug dealers, tax evaders, libertarians, and speculators alike to move money across the world outside of the watchful eye of traditional financial institutions. While the currency’s decentralized, unregulated nature was part of its appeal for many, those very traits also made the currency susceptible to attacks. The very first Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsed in 2014 after hackers exposed security loopholes and made off with $500 million in cryptocurrency.
In 2016, Bitfinex—one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time—suffered its own security breach. Some 2,000 transactions were approved from users’ accounts, sending the Bitcoin to one wallet. (A wallet is something like a decentralized bank account for cryptocurrency; they are unique to each user, but don’t have to be linked to a person’s real-world identity.) The hack upended the entire crypto ecosystem, with the value of Bitcoin plunging about 20% within hours.
It’s worth noting that neither Lichtenstein nor Morgan are accused of perpetrating the actual hack. “It’s potentially more difficult to prove the hack,” Redbord, who himself worked at the Attorney General’s office for 11 years, says.
The laundering
After the hack, the wallet in question had tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in a single account. But to extract it in large withdrawals would arouse plenty of suspicion. Most of the cryptocurrency was simply left in the account to appreciate in value.
In early 2017, small amounts of money began to exit the wallet through Alphabay, a currency exchange on the dark web that was often used to transact deals for drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods, according to investigators. By routing crypto through Alphabay, the trail of money on the blockchain itself would run cold. The launderers could then simply deposit the money in another Bitcoin wallet with its provenance obscured.
When Alphabay was shut down by law enforcement in 2017, the perpetrators switched to routing the money through the Russian-language marketplace Hydra, according to Tom Robinson at Elliptic, who has been tracking the money flow of the hack using tracing techniques and other software. Three years later, as Bitcoin prices spiked, the launderers employed a type of transaction known as a “coinjoin,” using Wasabi Wallet, a privacy wallet designed to prevent blockchain tracing. These methods amounted to the most “state-of-the-art laundering techniques” at the time, Robinson says.
Lisa O. Monaco, the U.S. Deputy Attorney General, alleges that it was Lichtenstein and Morgan who undertook these operations. According to Monaco’s statement, they used darknet services in conjunction with a series of complicated maneuvers that amounted to “a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions,” including opening accounts under false names, moving funds in thousands of small, separate transactions that were automated by computer so as to pass under the radar of financial watchdogs.
Eventually, the funds made their way into more traditional financial accounts held by Lichtenstein and Morgan, who spent the money on gold, NFTs and a Walmart gift card that was used to pay for Ubers and a Playstation, according to charging documents. A vast amount of Bitcoin—hundreds of millions of dollars worth—was converted into real money, but there was still a long way to go: 80% of the funds that had initially been deposited into the initial crypto wallet after the hack remained there until January 31.
The chase
As the launderers tried technique after technique to move the money, efforts to combat scammers were escalating—particularly in the U.S. Regulatory agencies were taking notice, investigating large scams. U.S.-based crypto currency exchanges were falling in line under the purview of the Department of Treasury, which required that they establish anti-money laundering (AML) programs and KYC (know-your-customer) protocols to make it harder for anonymous users to transfer money.
Meanwhile, crypto researchers and coders were building out more sophisticated tracking tools, hoping to bring some order and accountability to a space rife with scamming and bad actors. TRM Labs, for example, developed a tool to combat the effectiveness of “chain-hopping,” a set of actions in which launderers move funds rapidly across different blockchains (like converting Bitcoin to Ethereum to Solana). Elliptic, similarly, developed automated tracing techniques to track money across “peeling chains,” in which cryptocurrency is routed through a bevy of addresses. Last May, Robinson wrote a detailed blog post about the web of laundering from the Bitfinex hack money, complete with detailed graphics of where the money was ending up.
But while experts like Robinson knew which cryptocurrency accounts stored the stolen Bitcoin, linking blockchain addresses to actual people was another matter entirely. Robinson says that the Justice Department’s efforts were aided tremendously by the fact that AlphaBay had been shut down in 2017 by an international law enforcement effort led by the FBI. This shutdown, Robinson believes, gave law enforcement access to the service’s internal transaction logs, which helped officials concretely connect the dots between the wallet linked to the 2016 hack and the laundered accounts. “The fact that law enforcement took down AlphaBay probably led to [Lichtenstein and Morgan’s] downfall,” Robinson says.
With the biggest piece of the puzzle found, officials began finding links between the smaller shell accounts and bank accounts that belonged to Lichtenstein and Morgan, according to the charging papers. In January, they obtained a search warrant for a cloud storage account belonging to Lichtenstein, where they found a list of wallet addresses linked to the hack with their passwords. One of those wallets stored the majority of the remaining money: 94,000 Bitcoin, documents alleged. Using Lichtenstein’s passwords in the cloud, they entered the account and seized the funds, investigators said.
Redbord says the speed and force with which the investigation and seizure was carried out was aided by the transparent nature of the blockchain. “Law enforcement investigators have never had a more open way to follow the money,” Redbord says. “This shows cybercriminals that just because it’s years after a hack, don’t think you’ve gotten away with it: We’re going to trace those funds until we can seize them.” U.S. officials said that while a judge would ultimately decide how the recovered money would be distributed, the government would seek to return funds to their original owners.
This may only be the beginning of the DOJ’s efforts to crack down on crypto scams. The feds have been highly active, launching a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team last year to expand investigations of money laundering and other financial crimes. Last June, it recovered millions of dollars from the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. Meanwhile, other regulatory bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are positioning themselves to get a piece of the regulatory action.
Redbord says that amid all of the fierce debate about regulation surrounding the cryptocurrency space, both online and increasingly in the halls of Congress, a lot of regulation is “already in place” to allow an oversight action like the one that just occurred. “Every exchange, every broker, every ATM, every custodian, is required by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [a bureau of the Department of the Treasury] to have a compliance program, to report suspicious activity,” he says.
“To me, this case says to the policymakers [in Congress] that law enforcement has the tools, the training and the ability to follow the flow of funds in crypto,” Redbord says. “This is not just an anonymous thing used only for money laundering and fraud. In fact, the blockchain itself can be a powerful tool for investigating financial crime.”

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as it dropped $1,800 after January's CPI print came in at 7.5%.
Despite being 0.2% higher than expected, surging inflation failed to have the positive impact on risk assets such as Bitcoin that characterized recent months.
Given the pace of year-on-year price increases, analysts argued, the Federal Reserve may now have more impetus to begin interest rate hikes sooner.
""The Consumer Price Index (CPI) results for the U.S.A. are coming in at 7.5% year-over-year, the expectations were 7.3% year-over-year. DXY is shooting up and risk-on assets are dropping down like Bitcoin & equities,"" Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe reacted.

Funny, I thought Bitcoin was supposed to go up whenever they admit that inflation is bad, but instead people dump it because they are afraid the Fed will actually try to deal with inflation, proving once again that humans are dumb af. — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) February 10, 2022
For economist Lyn Alden, however, it was cash savers with inflation that was dealing the real pain.
""Official inflation currently has its biggest gap over short-term interest rates since 1951,"" she noted alongside a chart.
""People holding cash in a bank or T-bills over the past year lost over 7% of their purchasing power.""

BTC price recovers above $44,000
No sooner had Wall Street trading begun on Feb. 10, however, did Bitcoin not only reverse its losses but put in a higher high of nearly $45,400.

BTC/USD likewise avoided a retest of recent support, with $42,000 and lower still yet to see a retest.
Previously, Cointelegraph reported on the likely resistance zones now in play for bulls to grapple with to continue higher.
""A Bitcoin uptrend in the face of macro uncertainty would be quite powerful. Shifts the narrative from TradFi's court with BTC being a risk-on asset to purely a story of global adoption and ensuing game theory.

Veteran investor and fund manager Bill Miller says he has “a very big position” in bitcoin and expects to see a lot of institutional adoption this year, particularly among endowments and foundations. “Bitcoin is insurance against financial catastrophe,” he opined.
Bill Miller Says ‘Bitcoin Is Insurance Against Financial Catastrophe’
Famed value investor Bill Miller talked about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Wednesday. He is the founder of Miller Value Partners and currently serves as its chairman and chief investment officer. He manages the firm’s Opportunity Equity and Income Strategy funds. Prior to Miller Value Partners, he co-founded Legg Mason Capital Management.
Referring to bitcoin, Miller described, “It’s like an insurance policy.” He elaborated: “Insurance policies have no intrinsic value. In fact, you want them to have no intrinsic value. You don’t want to have your house burned down or get in a terrible accident but you pay for insurance every year in case that happens.” Miller continued:
Bitcoin is insurance against financial catastrophe as we see in Lebanon, or in Afghanistan, or many of these other countries where we saw around the time of the pandemic.
Miller also clarified what he said in January about bitcoin being half of his net worth, noting that many media reports misinterpreted what he said. Miller explained that he only put a few percent of his net worth into bitcoin which then grew to become half of his total fortune as the price of the cryptocurrency soared. However, he added that now BTC accounts for less than half of his total net worth because the price has fallen since its high in November.
“I put a few percent of my net worth in it a long time ago and it grew to be half of my net worth. Now it’s less than that because it’s down half since November. But it’s still a very big position,” he said.
Commenting on KPMG Canada buying bitcoin and ether for its corporate treasury, Miller said he sees the move as bullish for the crypto sector. The billionaire fund manager opined:
I think you’re going to see a lot of adoption among foundations and endowments and institutions this year, and that’s going to continue.
The veteran investor has long been pro-bitcoin. In September last year, his hedge fund company told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a filing that bitcoin has “significant upside potential” as digital gold.
When the price of bitcoin fell in May last year, he was unfazed by the falling price, emphasizing that bitcoin price corrections are pretty common.

Texans are broadly looking to pick up on China’s missed opportunity, as the Chinese government forces bitcoin mining operations to relocate or go underground, ensuring that Texas will have a major role to play in the cryptocurrency industry.
“We have launched our first bitcoin mine in downtown Fort Worth, which will be a showpiece for our larger mine located right outside the city,” Geosyn Mining co-founder Caleb Ward described a new Texas facility that opened in January 2022. “We’re using income from this 20,000-square-foot facility outside of Fort Worth to bootstrap a significant solar power build.”
By the end of March, Ward expects to have roughly 530 bitcoin mining machines operating in his facility alone. And he’s not the only bitcoin miner turning an eye toward Texas. There are reportedly 27 local bitcoin mining companies tallied by the Texas Blockchain Council. Abbott’s challenger in the upcoming election, Don Huffines, a Republican real estate developer and candidate for Texas governor, recently said that he would look to opportunities beyond the mining industry and be even more pro-bitcoin than Abbott. Huffines said he would make bitcoin tender if he’s elected.
Across the board, Texan politicians appear to be pro-bitcoin. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in October 2021 that bitcoin mining could help “strengthen our energy infrastructure.” There are, however, critics in Congress who doubt the bitcoin mining industry would benefit the power grid. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., pointed out in January that bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining process requires massive amounts of power.
Texas will be the bitcoin capital of the world in the next two years. Poolin CEO Kevin Pan
“Last year, there were hundreds of thousands of transactions on this network. Just imagine the climate implications,” Pallone said.
The massive shift of bitcoin mining facilities to Texas, currently underway, could offer a proving ground for whether the mining industry is good, or bad, for the power grid. Supporters argue bitcoin mining will help regulate energy demand across the grid. Critics say it will take more energy than it provides and regulates. The stakes have never been higher. Over the past year the Texas power grid experienced multiple failures, with deadly consequences. Some analysts blame privatization for the electricity infrastructure’s woeful state. Right now it’s still prohibitively expensive and difficult to send energy from production sites to consumers. Electricity gets lost in translation, crippling the grid.
Meanwhile, the march of businessmen and equipment continues. Poolin CEO Kevin Pan, leading one of the top bitcoin mining companies in the world and representing roughly 13% of the global network hashrate, told TechCrunch that his own company’s goal is to expand their new two-gigawatt mining facility in Texas, more than quadrupling their operations in Texas over time.
“Texas will be the bitcoin capital of the world in the next two years,” Pan said.
Pan and Ward both said the best way to make Cruz’s vision happen, using bitcoin mining to strengthen the energy infrastructure in Texas, is to power bitcoin mining facilities using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.
“We’re building solar panels around our site in Texas,” Pan said. “There’s a lot of wind mills around the coast as well.”
Wind power is generally seasonal, fluctuating from 7-20% of energy production in Texas, depending on the month. Because solar power has the same temporal limits, these bitcoin miners will use a mixture of energy sources throughout the year. Mining consultant Alejandro de la Torre, founder of ProofofWork.Energy, said that’s why Texas lawmakers are busy meeting with bitcoin mining executives from around the world. They’re working to counteract the assumption that the local bitcoin mining industry’s power consumption will harm the environment. If companies build, from the start, to optimize for local renewable energy sources, then the industry could expand to bring in lucrative taxes as reliance on the oil and gas industry wanes.
“In Texas, they’ve been incentivizing renewable energy initiatives so that it’s affordable to add wind and solar power equipment,” de la Torre said. “I’m focused right now on connecting Chinese miners to businesses in Texas. One of the main reasons that Chinese miners are interested in operating in Texas is they believe it is less likely the government will come to shut down their operations if they’re located in Texas.”
When the pandemic started, Chinese facilities managed roughly 65% of the bitcoin network’s global hashrate, compared to just 8% in the United States. It remains to be seen if the bitcoin cowboys of Texas will help the Americans conquer the industry by 2024, as Pan predicted.
China’s ongoing regulatory crackdown on bitcoin miners now outweighs the local economic incentives, the hydropower subsidies that made bitcoin mining so profitable in China. So those Chinese companies are moving to Texas and competing with American bitcoin companies like Riot Blockchain.
“Before this year China was the biggest market for bitcoin mining equipment. So the standards and transformers were optimized for China,” Pan explained, noting that miners are the most profitable when the hardware is optimized for the local environment, including the local power grid. “Manufacturers are already switching to making hardware for American standards…Riot Blockchain started building in Texas two or three years ago, so they have the advantage in Texas.”
As such, Pan said he believes Riot Blockchain will become one of the world’s leading bitcoin companies, rivaling Poolin, over the next few years. Meanwhile, Ward added that the best way for smaller bitcoin miners in Texas, like himself, to become globally competitive is to tap into the renewable energy sector.
“When you can consume 20% of your electricity on site and sell roughly 80% back into the grid, and can shut down our miners in a minute if we need during peak hours, that offers a massive benefit with regards to smoothing our supply and demand across the energy grid,” Ward said, describing the benefits of building on-site solar panels.
“We can still make money [when bitcoin miners are turned off] by selling our leftover solar energy back into the wholesale system. This won’t hurt our profitability, yet the relief it could provide to the end consumer could be massive,” he said.
Ward doesn’t want Geosyn Mining to stay a small player for long. The goal is for his company to bootstrap a $1 billion facility by starting small and renting bitcoin miners to American retail consumers. Ward’s company buys and operates the machines, charging a percentage of the bitcoin mined, giving the bulk of newly mined bitcoin to remote customers.
“For example, a retired schoolteacher was able to purchase four ASIC miners from us that will yield her approximately two bitcoin in two years,” Ward said. “We plan to house approximately 2,400 of our own miners in this [second] location, as well as a significant number of client miners. Ultimately, this will provide us with the financial ability to break ground on our first solar farm by year’s end.”
Although Texas renewable energy subsidies pale in comparison to the cheap electricity once provided by Chinese dams, Texan politicians are eager to attract industry experts by reducing the reputational risk associated with bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. In addition to Texas Governor Greg Abbott meeting with bitcoin miners and hyping up the industry, the GOP primary challenger, former state senator Don Huffines, also announced his own pro-bitcoin mining strategy.
“I am committed to making Texas the Citadel for Bitcoin,” Huffines said in a statement.
Indeed, EnergyFunders CEO Laura Pommer, who recently launched a bitcoin fund investment service relying on two new natural gas-powered bitcoin mining facilities in Texas, said that “all the people running for office in Texas right now are pro-bitcoin and want to make it easier for Texans to mine bitcoin.”
It appears that most Texan political candidates running for various offices in 2022 plan to make the bitcoin mining industry an integral part of Texas’s energy infrastructure.
“We’re going to see exponential growth in the bitcoin mining industry in Texas,” she said. “Our customers are earning profits in bitcoin or dollars, it’s their choice…We’re waiting for more of our miners to arrive from China, we’ve already got one tranche of mines in.”
It’s worth noting that EnergyFunders’ mining operations are off-the-grid, relying on natural gas instead. So they won’t add stress to the overburdened and congested power grid across Texas. Overall, only time will tell who will benefit from the millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin being mined in Texas throughout this gubernatorial election and subsequent term.
“Texas is a totally different market,” Pan said, betting that either outcome will benefit bitcoin miners. “We want to do long-term business here.”
Pommer Fidler, who has previous experience working in the energy industry in Colorado and Wyoming, agreed.
“There are more on-grid facilities spinning up more bitcoin mining, as well, plus a lot of people like the idea of having fractional ownership of [EnergyFunders’] off-the-grid bitcoin mines,” she said. “Texas is Bitcoin country.”"

As of Feb. 10, the total supply in these addresses was 8.096 million BTC versus 7.95 million on Jan. 24, according to data from Coin Metrics.
Bitcoin whales and institutional inflows
The buying sentiment among the richest crypto investors picked momentum during Bitcoin’s recovery in the past two weeks as BTC rebounded from its 2022 low of $33,000 on Jan. 24 to around $43,500 on Feb. 11.

Small Bitcoin investors, addresses that hold less than 1 BTC, so-called “fishes,” also joined the accumulation spree during the recent Bitcoin price rebound.
Meanwhile, data resource Ecoinometrics shows the Coin Metrics data in the form of clusters, showing a synchronous accumulation behavior among Bitcoin whales and fishes.
Interestingly, the clusters looked the same as they did in the days leading up to BTC’s record high of $69,000 in November 2021.

“Once more this cycle, this rebound in price correlates pretty well with both the small fish and the whales addresses buying simultaneously for an extended period of time, wrote Nick, an analyst at Ecoinometrics, in a note published on Fed. 7, adding:
“I don’t know if this signal is going to continue being predictive of a sustained rally, but hey, for now it is working fine.”
A report published by CoinShares this week also showed a rise in inflow across crypto funds last week. Notably, the capital injections into these funds have quadrupled to $85 billion, with $71 million flowing into Bitcoin-focused investment products, suggesting renewed institutional interest is also buoying BTC’s price recovery.

“Right now it is just warming up”
Nick suggested that Bitcoin has enough room to grow its valuation in the coming months, citing a so-called “aggregated risk score,” derived from four parameters: risk of overextended market, risk of a low-demand and high-supply situation, risk of holders taking profits, and risk of increased selling pressure.

The bizarre case of a New York couple accused of trying to launder $4.5 billion in bitcoin stolen in a 2016 hack will be the subject of a docuseries on Netflix, the streaming company said Friday. The announcement comes just three days after the couple, Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein and Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan, were arrested in their lower Manhattan apartment. The Department of Justice at the time of the arrest said it had also seized more than $3.6 billion in bitcoin that was part of the alleged scheme, the biggest such financial seizure in DOJ history. Netflix said the series on the couple will be directed by Chris Smith, who helmed the Netflix series ""FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened,"" about the fraudulent Fyre Festival, and was executive producer of the company's Covid pandemic smash hit ""Tiger King.""
The deal comes amid a rise in appetite by Hollywood for stories about the tech world, mostly its failures and frauds. HBO this week ordered a series called ""Doomsday Machine,"" depicting Sheryl Sandberg, played by ""The Crown"" star Claire Foy, and Mark Zuckerberg, and ""chronicling the political and social minefields Facebook has navigated on its relentless quest for growth."" Also this week Hulu dropped the trailer for its forthcoming series about failed blood-testing start-up Theranos called ""The Drop Out,"" and Apple recently dropped its trailer for WeWork-inspired series ""WeCrashed."" Undoubtedly fueling Netflix's interest is Morgan's colorful social media footprint. The 31-year-old is a former Forbes.com contributor and self-described ""irreverent comedic rapper"" and ""crocodile of Wall Street"" whose rap videos were widely mocked on Twitter after her arrest. ""As the value of the stolen bitcoin soared from $71 million at the time of the hack to nearly $5 billion, the couple allegedly tried to liquidate their digital money by creating fake identities and online accounts, and buying physical gold, NFTs, and more — all while investigators raced to track the money's movement on the blockchain,"" Netflix said in its announcement Friday."
99,2022-02-11,2022-02-11,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Marcel Pechman,cointelegraph.com,Here’s why Bitcoin traders shouldn’t overanalyze US inflation data,"Analysts say record high inflation in the United States is impacting crypto market momentum, but is the impact of the data overstated to the detriment of investors?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-why-bitcoin-traders-shouldn-t-overanalyze-us-inflation-data,"Analysts and pundits will scramble to find some angle to explain intra-day price action whenever important economic numbers are published and this practice is commonplace in the crypto sector.
When the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 7.5% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Feb. 10, traders rushed to find some connection to the crypto price action. However, historical correlation data shows investors should actually closely scrutinize whether there is even a relation between Bitcoin (BTC) and major economic indicators.
General investment advice would suggest that traders ignore the intraday movements, especially considering that most assets do not trade on a 24-hours basis.
More importantly, Bitcoin’s order book depth pales in comparison to gold, WTI and the S&P 500 futures. Even if one aggregates stablecoin trading, Bitcoin’s 7-day average volume is $7 billion, whereas the three largest S&P 500 exchange-traded funds handle $54 billion.
In short, a large order flow from a single entity could easily distort the cryptocurrency market in the short term, but the impact on WTI oil, the S&P 500 and gold tends to be smaller.
Does Bitcoin price anticipate inflation data?
Bitcoin price dipped to $43,200 after the 7.5% increase in the U.S. consumer price index was released on Feb. 10, leading reporters at CNBC to correlate the two events.
Bitcoin dips slightly as 10-year Treasury yield tops 2% on hotter-than-expected inflation report https://t.co/bI8NzMQRPD — CNBC (@CNBC) February 10, 2022
That statement correctly assessed the market conditions at that time, but one should use a longer time frame when analyzing economic data. Furthermore, there’s the possibility that Bitcoin holds no relevant price correlation, a hypothesis that also needs testing.
A comparative long-term chart between Bitcoin price and U.S. inflation gives a false impression of correlation and causation, especially when using logarithmic charts.
U.S. CPI (orange, left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (blue, right). Source: TradingView
If anything, Bitcoin has anticipated the economic data by roughly three months. In September 2020, it rallied above $11,000 while the inflation data stagnated below 1.5% and more recently in May 2021.
Afterward, the Bitcoin price “cooled off,” failing to break the $60,000 support while the sharp increase in CPI paused two months later in July at 5.4%.
For those relying on mathematical formulas, the correlation coefficient between Bitcoin price and U.S. inflation oscillated between positive 0.95 and negative 0.94 over the past 12 months. Therefore, associating one to another makes very little sense from a statistical approach.
Related: Analysts say Bitcoin’s range-bound trading at a key support level reflects a trend reversal
Do traditional markets really show correlation with Bitcoin?
Another common mistake is attributing the correlation of other assets to Bitcoin’s performance. Sure enough, there might be a couple of consecutive months of 0.65 (positive or negative) correlation over a year-long period, but data suggests otherwise.
Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI Oil, and TIP ETF 30-day correlation charts. Source: TradingView
For instance, between August and September 2021, the S&P 500 correlation to BTC averaged 0.65. However, that is cherry-picking data because a more extended timeframe reveals no such evidence.
No price relation was found between Bitcoin and other major assets such as the WTI oil price and the iShares TIPS Bond ETF, which tracks an index composed of inflation-protected U.S. Treasury bonds.
Various data points suggest that investors should ignore the intraday price action after economic data is released, because at times, the data provides a false impression between correlation and causation.
Although inflation or other data influence short-term pricing, it does not necessarily impact the prevailing trend. The correlation chart versus traditional markets leaves little doubt that Bitcoin is a class of its own.

After bulls had something to celebrate last week, the current environment looks like a fresh dose of reality as BTC battles nervous stock markets, a resurgent United States dollar and more.
The picture is, as always, mixed — while spot price may not look too impressive, under the hood, Bitcoin is stronger than ever, and network participants are doubling down on their long-term commitments.
Add to that the slow decline of risky behavior on derivatives markets and the stage could be set for some sustainable price growth. Will it happen this week?
Cointelegraph presents five factors to consider in the coming days for BTC/USD.
Bitcoin tests new 50-day moving average support
After 10 days of recovery, Bitcoin is now reckoning with the resistance levels, which have bee absent from bulls’ radar since the middle of January.
Having passed $45,500 late last week, the weekend saw relatively calm conditions as the daily chart nonetheless saw a series of lower lows.
The weekly close, the topic of interest Sunday as price action stayed practically in an identical place to the end of last week, ultimately disappointed — BTC/USD set a lower close of just under $42,000.
With that, however, comes the possibility of short-term upside to fill the CME futures “gap” now above spot price at near $42,400.
“Bitcoin is still just sitting in between support and resistance,” popular commentator Matthew Hyland summarized Monday, adding that he was “relaxing” in the face of current price moves.
With support and resistance levels close by, trader and analyst Rekt Capital, meanwhile, reiterated BTC’s relative weakness when it comes to reclaiming support levels on a macro scale.
Previously, he had identified two moving averages that needed to be reconfirmed as support in order for Bitcoin to have a shot at its all-time high from November.

Closer to home, the 50-day moving average is being challenged as the new week begins after a week of action above, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.

DXY sours risk asset mood
Bitcoin’s reversal toward $40,000 may not be helped by an advancing U.S. dollar.
Since Feb. 4, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) has been on the rebound, canceling a steep downtrend that had characterized the week prior.
That traditionally spells problems for risk assets, and as of Monday, DXY was trading back above the 96 mark.

For stocks, already uninspired by the potential for U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes in March, the geopolitical situation involving Ukraine and Russia remains a factor providing nervousness this week.
“Over the past century, there were only four years where both stocks and bonds had a negative year,” analyst Lyn Alden noted.
“Obviously it is super early, but so far both stocks and bonds have had negative returns in 2022.”
Oil, meanwhile, continued on its journey to the $100 mark on the same tensions, Brent Crude futures passing $96 a barrel Monday.
As Cointelegraph reported, both oil and Bitcoin remain a macro pick for this year.
Spot price starts leading futures
Amid the rise to and the comedown from local highs, interesting activity has been taking place on Bitcoin derivatives markets.
As noted by Twitter monitors, including Glassnode lead analyst Checkmate, open interest leverage has been disappearing from futures markets — and with it, the risk of getting deleveraged or “liquidated.”
This time, however, the reduction is not coming from a sweeping change in price knocking out positions. Instead, investors themselves are choosing to change their strategy.
“Bitcoin futures leverage has fallen significantly this week, falling from 2.0% of Market cap, to 1.75%,” Checkmate tweeted Sunday alongside a chart showing the de-risking.
“However, this was NOT the liquidation cascade we all know and love. This is from traders choosing to close out their positions, far healthier. I expect spot to lead now.”

Regarding the relationship between spot and futures prices, fellow commentator Byzantine General added that there is now the potential for futures to begin trading below, rather than above spot price.
The divergence between the futures basis and spot is already “pretty significant,” he added in his own post overnight.

At the time of writing, CME futures were trading around $200 below the spot price at exactly $42,000.
Hash rate follows difficulty to all-time highs
It’s been a straight winning year for Bitcoin’s network fundamentals so far, and this week is no exception.
Over the weekend, hash rate charts — an estimate of the processing power dedicated to mining — surged to new all-time highs.
While knowing the exact level of hashing power active on the Bitcoin network is impossible, hash rate estimates have shown a clear uptrend since the middle of last year, and the ecosystem took a matter of months to fully cancel out the impact of China’s enforced miner migration.
Now, with the U.S. taking center stage for mining, it appears that it is a race to the top for participants.
Hash rate did NOT jump 58 EH/s in 24 hours.

Few understand this. pic.twitter.com/l6FHMDOXXW — Joe Burnett ()³ (@IIICapital) February 13, 2022
More easily measurable is Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, which has also recovered fully after diving to take into account the reduced hashing activity post-China.
As of Monday, difficulty stood at 26.69 trillion, but moreover, its next automated adjustment will send it even higher still — over 27 trillion for the first time.
The adjustment will kick in in around three days and represent approximately a 2.2% increase.

Keep on hodlin’
There is a firm sense of conviction among Bitcoin hodlers, and while this is common knowledge, the extent of their resolve is becoming clearer than ever.

As noted by the popular Twitter account known as PlanC, wallets thought to belong to long-term hodlers are increasing dramatically — and recent price action has only helped the trend.
Citing Glassnode data, PlanC noted that those entities, defined as wallets with a least two significant incoming transactions and zero outgoing transactions, have now hit an almost five-year high.

Despite the value dropping to 209.63 EH/s on Sunday, the world’s leading blockchain network is now as secure as ever.
In blockchains that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, hashrate refers to the total combined computational power allocated by a network of computers, called “miners,” to process transactions and add blocks onto the blockchain.
The higher the hashrate, the more secure the network is as more computing power is required to perform a successful attack, like process fraudulent transactions or report that the same Bitcoin has been used twice (called a “double-spend”).
1 million TH/s is the equivalent of 1 EH/s. Source: Blockchain.com.
Coupled with the record-high Bitcoin mining difficulty—the measure of how difficult it is to find new blocks—a rising hashrate is a rather bullish signal indicating that miners are increasingly willing to deploy long-term capital into Bitcoin’s infrastructure.
As data from BTC.com shows, Bitcoin mining difficulty is expected to increase by a further 3.24% later this week, when the value’s next readjustment happens.
Macro signals and Bitcoin
Bitcoin’s network has been on a roller-coaster ride following China’s crackdown on the mining industry last year, which resulted in the hashrate plummeting to as low as 58 EH/s in July, raising concerns about the industry’s long-term prospects.
However, with several major Bitcoin mining operators moving to other countries, such as the U.S., Russia, and Kazakhstan, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been on a constant rebound since then.
The latest spike in hashrate also comes amid negative macro sentiments across the global markets, such as growing inflation and geopolitical tensions.
U.S. inflation hit its highest level in 40 years last week, causing investors to dispose of riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.
Continuing talks of Russia’s possible military invasion of its neighbor country Ukraine isn’t helping either.
Following the White House’s statement last week that Russia could launch a major assault on Ukraine “essentially at any time,” the price of Bitcoin sank almost 4% while leading stock indices fell between 1.43% and 2.78%.
At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency was changing hands at $42,200, down 0.3% over the last day, according to CoinGecko. However, the network’s fundamentals, such as the exploding hashrate, continue to grow stronger."

Almost everyone has heard about Bitcoin, the world's first and most valuable cryptocurrency. But you may have also heard of Bitcoin Cash, another popular and valuable currency that now has a solid footing in the market.
So, what exactly is the difference between these two tokens, and what does each of them offer?
The Origins of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
An elusive character named Satoshi Nakamoto developed and launched Bitcoin in 2007. It was the world's first cryptocurrency. In a sense, Bitcoin set the stage for future cryptos and has become something of a household name.
MAKEUSEOF VIDEO OF THE DAY
This cryptocurrency is now the most valuable in the world by far. Its value skyrocketed from a few hundred dollars in the mid-2010s to tens of thousands of dollars a few years later. At one time, a Bitcoin could buy you a latte. Nowadays, you could buy a new car with one.
However, the Bitcoin you see today is not exactly what developers had in mind. Their aim was for people to use Bitcoin as part of a peer-to-peer electronic payment system. But its frustratingly volatile nature means that this wasn't possible. Enter Bitcoin Cash.
Related: Why Can't Bitcoin be Staked? Will Bitcoin Switch to PoS?
In the mid-2010s, concerns surrounding Bitcoin's shortcomings were increasing. The crypto, rising in value, had frustratingly long transaction times and was difficult to scale effectively. So, in 2017, a few miners and developers created a Bitcoin-related cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash to overcome these issues.
The development of Bitcoin Cash involved a hard fork occurring on the original Bitcoin blockchain. A hard fork involves a blockchain protocol splitting and creating two separate chains. So, Bitcoin Cash consists of the same basic code used for Bitcoin, but with some added alterations and modifications. Think of it like two new species evolving from one predecessor on an evolutionary tree.
So, if the point of Bitcoin Cash is to make up for Bitcoin's shortcomings, what helpful features does it have?
How Does Bitcoin Cash Differ From Bitcoin?
Firstly, Bitcoin Cash's transaction period is also much shorter than that of Bitcoin. Currently, a Bitcoin transaction takes around 10 minutes. Compared to your standard Visa transaction, this is incredibly long. A Bitcoin Cash transaction can take as little as two minutes because Bitcoin Cash is more scalable. More people can be on the blockchain, conducting transactions, at the same time without having to deal with long waiting periods.
Another big difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is the block sizes of the two separate cryptos. Until recently, Bitcoin's block size was just 1MB. Using SegWit2x, an upgrade that miners voted to integrate in 2017, Bitcoin's block size could increase to 2MB. But this is still pretty small when you compare it to Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash's block size is a considerably larger 32MB. Larger blocks mean each can contain more transactions, so Bitcoin Cash is more scalable.
This prevents huge backlogs of pending transactions from building up, which is currently a big problem for Bitcoin. At certain times, as many as 100,000 transactions could be waiting in this backlog, which can cause big problems for the network and create considerable user frustration.
Related: Can You Cancel a Cryptocurrency Transaction?
Bitcoin Cash also has cheaper transaction fees, making it more affordable to use overall than Bitcoin. For one transaction, you'll incur a fee of just 20 cents with Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash also makes use of smart contracts. These are essentially computer programs designed to automatically execute legal digital agreements. In short, they can simplify trades between two parties without the need for intermediaries. This removes the risk of human error, heightens security, and also contributes to Bitcoin Cash's speed.
At this point, you may be wondering if Bitcoin Cash is valuable at all. Well, if you compare any crypto's value to that of Bitcoin, you'll probably come out disappointed. But Bitcoin Cash currently sits among the top 30 most popular and valuable cryptos around the world. So, it's not at the level of Bitcoin but is by no means worthless.
But it hasn't exactly been smooth sailing for Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash, like Bitcoin, is a cryptocurrency. So, like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is subject to considerable volatility in terms of value. Since its launch onto the market, Bitcoin Cash's price has fluctuated significantly several times. This crypto's value has ranged between a few hundred dollars to over three thousand dollars over the past five years, so it's not exactly a stable token.
So, if Bitcoin Cash outshines Bitcoins in so many ways, why is Bitcoin still a market leader and by far the most valuable crypto?
Why Is Bitcoin More Popular Than Bitcoin Cash?
It's important to note that, for many people, Bitcoin is something of a revolution. It has changed how they use, buy, and earn money, and has led to the rise of a multi-billion-dollar industry. Because of this, Bitcoin has a bit of a cult following. Many Bitcoin owners and miners swear by this specific crypto, so a hard fork wouldn't necessarily reduce its popularity.
Related: Who Owns the Most Bitcoin in the World?
On top of this, Bitcoin is probably the only crypto that's a household name. Many crypto novices see Bitcoin as the best investment option solely because of its popularity and value. If a person views crypto solely as a long-term investment, they may not much care about transaction times, block sizes, and scalability.
Bitcoin certainly does have its flaws, and there's no knowing whether its developers will modify it in the future based on user demand. As the wider population gets more familiar with cryptocurrencies, a bigger focus on convenience may develop.
These Two Cryptos Have a Promising Future
Though Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash differ significantly in their value and demand, both cryptos seem to have a very promising future. Bitcoin continues to be a widely-loved crypto with a loyal following. Bitcoin Cash's features make it a convenient and affordable crypto to trade. Depending on your preferences, either of these tokens could work well for you."

104,2022-02-14,2022-02-14,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Condé Nast,Ed Caesar",www.newyorker.com,How a Young Couple Failed to Launder Billions of Dollars in Stolen Bitcoin,The case against Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan describes a big crime followed by a series of frustrations.,https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/how-a-young-couple-failed-to-launder-billions-of-dollars-in-stolen-bitcoin,"In August, 2016, a hacker stole 119,754 bitcoin from a cryptocurrency exchange called Bitfinex. On Tuesday, in Manhattan, a young married couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, appeared in federal court, charged with attempting to launder the proceeds of that crime. When the exchange was hacked, the stolen bitcoin was worth about seventy-one million dollars. Today, its value is more than five billion dollars. Shortly before their arrest, one could argue that—on paper, at least—Lichtenstein and Morgan were richer than Peter Thiel, who founded PayPal.
Lichtenstein is a thirty-four-year-old with dual Russian-American citizenship, who describes himself on Medium as a “tech entrepreneur, explorer, and occasional magician.” He goes by “Dutch.” His Twitter feed (@unrealdutch) is a stream of aloof commentary on cryptocurrency, Web 3.0, and non-fungible tokens. On New Year’s Eve, he retweeted Edward Snowden’s picture of fireworks over the Kremlin. Morgan, who is thirty-one, married Lichtenstein last year. Among other pursuits, she is a journalist. In her biography for Forbes, which she wrote for until last year, Morgan describes herself as “an international economist, serial entrepreneur, and investor” and “an expert in persuasion, social engineering, and game theory.” “When she’s not reverse-engineering black markets to think of better ways to combat fraud and cybercrime,” her bio reads, “she enjoys rapping and designing streetwear fashion.”
Morgan really does seem to enjoy rapping. She spits bars as Razzlekhan, and styles herself the “Crocodile of Wall Street.” The keystone of Razzlekhan’s œuvre is a track called “Versace Bedouin,” a paean to grind culture and financial speculation, in which Morgan nods to her multi-hyphenate career. (“I’m many things: a rapper, an economist, a journalist, a writer, a C.E.O., and a dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty ho.”) In the video for “Versace Bedouin,” Morgan wears a gold lamé jacket and a baseball cap bearing the slogan “ØFCKS.” It was filmed on Wall Street itself, which is also where the couple lives, in a rented two-bed condominium.
Morgan and Lichtenstein were charged last week with conspiring to launder money and conspiring to defraud the United States. Most subsequent media coverage of the case has naturally focussed on their colorful online personae. (I am not immune. In my house, “Versace Bedouin” has been on repeat.) But the details of the case are equally intriguing, because they gesture at the potential and pitfalls of digital currency for criminal activity.
The case against Morgan and Lichtenstein, as detailed in the affidavit, describes a big crime followed by a series of frustrations. After the hack of Bitfinex, in 2016, the stolen bitcoin was transferred to an outside wallet. The government has not said that Lichtenstein and Morgan hacked the exchange; they are charged only with laundering the proceeds of the hack. But it appears that the couple never even tried to launder most of the stolen coins—94,636 bitcoin, or about eighty per cent of the total loot, never left the first wallet. The reason? Laundering digital currency is hard. And the level of difficulty rises as the sums grow larger.
As I discovered last year, while reporting on state-sponsored North Korean hackers, thefts from digital-currency exchanges happen with alarming regularity. North Korean operatives particularly enjoy hacking digital bourses in South Korea. As of last April, one exchange, Bithumb, had been raided four times. Exchanges are vulnerable because they often maintain escrow accounts holding coins in so-called hot wallets, which are connected to the Internet. (The more secure, but laborious, way to store coins is in a “cold wallet,” which is not connected to the Internet; the keys to the wallet are written down or memorized elsewhere.) Through some often-ingenious tricks, such as impersonating a trusted business partner in order to plant malware on an exchange employee’s computer, criminals find ways to commandeer the keys to hot wallets, and steal coins.
Last year, Tom Robinson, who is the chief scientist at the blockchain-analytics firm Elliptic, explained to me the appeal of this kind of crime. “Once the funds have moved out of the exchange, you can’t reverse those transactions, like you can maybe with a traditional bank payment,” Robinson said. “Once they’re gone, they’re gone. And there’s no intermediary, there’s no controller of bitcoin, who you can go to and say, ‘Those funds are stolen. Give them back to me.’ It’s completely decentralized. It can also be fairly anonymous—you don’t need to enact the scheme through accounts linked to your identity.”
But if digital currency creates opportunities for thieves it also presents giant obstacles. The desired end point of most exchange hacks is to convert stolen digital currency into fiat currency—pounds, euros, dollars. That’s hard to do if exchanges have adequate know-your-customer (K.Y.C.) or anti-money-laundering (A.M.L.) structures in place. If you dump a billion dollars’ worth of bitcoin at a reputable exchange’s feet and ask for dollars in response, its A.M.L. team should ask some tough questions.
Launderers must also contend with the fact that coins are traceable. The ledger on which trades occur is immutable. It should always be possible to track stolen loot through its digital footprint. The problem of handling stolen bitcoin is not unlike that of smuggling a Picasso in the trunk of your car. Everybody knows it’s a Picasso because it looks like a Picasso and it’s got Picasso’s signature on it. Stealing the painting is one thing; realizing any monetary gain for it is another.
Morgan and Lichtenstein seem to have understood some of the dangerous terrain of the crypto laundry. The affidavit claims that, among other techniques, the couple moved some of the bitcoin out of the holding wallet using “a series of small, complex transactions across multiple accounts and platforms,” adding that “this shuffling, which created a voluminous number of transactions, appeared to be designed to conceal the path of the stolen BTC, making it difficult for law enforcement to trace the funds.” This atomized transfer is sometimes known as a peel chain. Last year, Robinson, the Elliptic scientist, showed me a visualization of a peel chain. The diagram looked like an airline-magazine route map, in which several lines sprout from one dot and then converge on another.
The affidavit also details how the couple understood other, more sophisticated laundering techniques. One is known as chain hopping. This is when one type of coin is swapped for another—Bitcoin to Ethereum, for instance—to disguise its provenance. The blockchain-forensics firm Chainalysis recently published a report that detailed the growing use of chain hopping, particularly by North Korean criminal groups. The preferred method is to use what is known as a DeFi (decentralized finance) platform, which swaps currencies without ever taking custody of the funds. DeFis are not required to have any know-your-customer procedures. According to Chainalysis, in 2020, North Korean hackers used a DeFi called Uniswap to launder the proceeds of a two-hundred-and-seventy-five-million-dollar theft from the KuCoin exchange—one of the largest hacks of any exchange ever.
Morgan and Lichtenstein also allegedly moved coins to AlphaBay, a dark-Web marketplace that was shuttered by police in 2017. You can buy pretty much anything you want using digital currency on the dark Web, and nobody cares where you got your funds. But it seems that the sums Morgan and Lichtenstein were looking to launder were too unwieldy to cash out by buying products. AlphaBay was simply a conduit for the stolen coins. The couple is alleged to have moved their funds through the dark-Web marketplace and back into other coin exchanges, which landed them in the same predicament as when they started: with a bunch of digital currency that they couldn’t spend. When they attempted to open seven new accounts on one exchange using fake identities, the exchange could not verify the accounts, and froze their funds.
The couple ran into locked door after locked door. They spent some of the coins on N.F.T.s, and some on a five-hundred-dollar Walmart gift card. They cashed out small amounts using gold trades and other techniques. Gurvais Grigg, a former F.B.I. agent who is now the public sector chief technical officer for Chainalysis, told me that Morgan and Lichtenstein’s attempts to launder their bitcoin had shown them to be “pretty sophisticated.” But they never found a way to make good on the billions of dollars’ worth of loot burning a hole in their digital pocket. “Eventually,” Grigg said, “you’ve got to move it to a place, or an exchange, or an O.T.C. [over-the-counter trader] that can help you.”
Reading the affidavit, I found myself asking: How would the North Koreans have washed so many coins? They would have done it slowly. Criminal groups associated with North Korea leave large volumes of cryptocurrency untouched in digital wallets for years. They also would have used some of the same techniques that Morgan and Lichtenstein did: peel chains and chain hopping. But they would have kept their real identities far away from any accounts handling the stolen coins. (They would never have used a real driver’s license to verify their identity, or have used their own home address for a gold trade, as Lichtenstein did.) Certainly, they would have found a way to cash out large sums, probably using an exchange in a lax jurisdiction.
In 2018, a digital-currency exchange in Hong Kong was hacked by a North Korean group. About 10,800 bitcoin was stolen. Today, the bitcoins would be worth nearly half a billion dollars. According to an indictment in 2020, these coins were then diverted, via peel chains, to two Chinese citizens, Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong, who had successfully opened accounts on other exchanges using fake pictures and fake names. Tian and Li then cashed out using a Chinese bank. According to the U.S. Treasury, several financial institutions in China offer accounts to North Koreans, or to front companies that have relationships with Pyongyang. In 2020, Tian and Li were accused in the United States of having laundered “stolen cryptocurrency to obscure transactions for the benefit of actors in North Korea.” (The men have been charged in absentia, and are still at large.)
The North Koreans prefer to cash out in China, but, according to the forensics firms that track cryptocurrency, there are also plenty of exchanges in Russia and Eastern Europe that will not ask awkward questions. Several exchanges in Moscow—including the over-the-counter brokerage Suex, which the Treasury sanctioned last fall—were named in a recent report by Chainalysis as “making a concerted effort to serve a cybercriminal clientele.” More than half of these Russian exchanges share a Moscow skyscraper: Federation Tower. The Chainalysis report noted that “nothing is more emblematic of the growth of Russia’s crypto crime ecosystem, and of cybercriminals’ ability to operate with apparent impunity, than the presence of so many cryptocurrency businesses linked to money laundering in one of the capital city’s most notable landmarks.”
It’s somewhat to Morgan and Lichtenstein’s credit that they appear not to have known where to cash out. They don’t seem like hardened criminals, although the courts may treat them as such. In a filing, the couple’s lawyer wrote, “Ms. Morgan and Mr. Lichtenstein have no reason to flee to avoid the government’s allegations, as the government’s complaint reveals significant holes in the government’s case against them.” He went on to write that “the money-laundering accusations in the government’s complaint are predicated on a series of circumstantial inferences and assumptions drawn from a complex web of convoluted blockchain-and cryptocurrency-tracing assertions.” There also remains the intriguing question of the bitcoin that the government has not yet found: some three hundred and thirty million dollars’ worth that is believed to be in wallets controlled by the couple. One wonders what will happen to that stash. Like most of the stolen loot from the Bitfinex raid, the answer is: probably nothing."

A top official of India’s central bank has compared cryptocurrency to a “Ponzi scheme” and suggested an outright ban in its sharpest criticism just weeks after the government proposed taxation of the virtual digital asset and paved way to recognize it as legal tender in the world’s second-largest internet market.
T. Rabi Sankar, deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), told an audience at a banking conference that cryptocurrencies have been “specifically developed to bypass the regulated financial system,” and are not backed by any underlying cash flow.
“We have also seen that cryptocurrencies are not amenable to definition as a currency, asset or commodity; they have no underlying cash flows, they have no intrinsic value; that they are akin to Ponzi schemes, and may even be worse,” he said.
Sankar’s remarks come at a time the Indian government has sent signals that it’s moving in the direction of recognizing the digital virtual asset as legal tender. The nation’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed taxing income accrued from transfer of cryptocurrencies and NFTs in the federal budget early this month.
The sale of cryptocurrencies and NFTs have made quick inroads in India in the past year despite regulatory uncertainty. The world’s second-largest internet market has seen the second-highest adoption rate for cryptocurrency investments, according to an analysis by research firm Chainalysis.
“The magnitude and frequency of these transactions have made it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime,” she said in her budget speech.
India’s central bank has so far been very cautious about cryptocurrencies. In 2018, it banned financial firms from dealing with cryptocurrency. The ban was overturned by India’s Supreme Court two years later, but most banks have continued to follow the RBI’s direction.
Sitharaman said on Monday that New Delhi and the RBI were holding discussions to formulate rules and that the two were “onboard.”
Sankar’s speech has made it clear that the RBI has not changed its long-held stance. “As a store of value, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have given impressive returns so far, but so did tulips in 17th century Netherlands. Cryptocurrencies are very much like a speculative or gambling contract working like a Ponzi scheme. In fact, it has been argued that the original scheme devised by Charles Ponzi in 1920 is better than cryptocurrencies from a social perspective,” he said.
Cryptocurrencies can “wreck” the currency system, the monetary authority, the banking system and in general the government’s ability to control the economy, he warned.
“They threaten the financial sovereignty of a country and make it susceptible to strategic manipulation by private corporates creating these currencies or governments that control them. All these factors lead to the conclusion that banning cryptocurrency is perhaps the most advisable choice open to India,” he said. “We have examined the arguments proffered by those advocating that cryptocurrencies should be regulated and found that none of them stand up to basic scrutiny.”"
106,2022-02-15,2022-02-15,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Helen Partz,cointelegraph.com,Russian ministry wants to legalize Bitcoin mining in specific areas,Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development has proposed to recognize crypto mining as a commercial activity and to allow mining in areas with a “sustainable surplus in electricity generation.”,https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ministry-wants-to-legalize-bitcoin-mining-in-specific-areas,"While the Russian government continues to work out a regulatory regime for digital assets, a federal ministry has made another proposal regarding the crypto mining industry.
Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development has greenlighted the concept of crypto mining regulation in the country, proposing to allow mining operations in areas with “sustainable surplus in electricity generation,” local news agency Izvestia reported Tuesday.
As part of the proposal, the ministry suggested introducing lower fees for setting up mining farms and data centers in specific Russian regions as well as offering reduced energy rates for such facilities.
The ministry also wants to establish a power use limit for mining by individuals, reportedly proposing to introduce higher energy rates for increased energy spending. The authority is yet to determine a threshold amount for this, the report notes.
According to the ministry, the newly proposed rules would remove the risks of insufficient power supply for housing, social facilities and infrastructure in other regions of the country.
Additionally, the ministry reportedly proposed recognizing crypto mining as a commercial activity and introducing taxes on realized profits from cryptocurrency mining.
The ministry did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. This article will be updated pending new information.

The latest proposal comes amid the ongoing uncertainty over crypto regulation in Russia, with different parts of the government still arguing on how to regulate Bitcoin (BTC).
As previously reported, Russia’s finance ministry has been advocating for regulating the crypto industry, while the Bank of Russia has been aggressively insisting to ban crypto transactions, citing investor protection risks. As the government formally approved the concept of crypto regulation on Feb. 8, Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina subsequently declared that the bank did not support the state’s decision and will continue to oppose crypto adoption in Russia.
The government and the central bank are reportedly expected to introduce a joint crypto regulation bill by this Friday.

Some major state-backed financial institutions in Russia have supported the idea of regulating crypto in the country recently. Anatoly Popov, deputy chairman of the executive board at Russia’s banking giant Sber, reportedly voiced the company’s support of regulating the industry rather than banning it.
“Our position coincides with the position of the government that cryptocurrencies should be regulated, not banned. Effective regulation is needed that will allow citizens and organizations to legally acquire cryptocurrency, take it into account AML [Anti-Money Laundering] mechanisms and taxation,” he said."
107,2022-02-15,2022-02-15,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Mackenzie Sigalos,www.cnbc.com,ConocoPhillips is selling extra gas to bitcoin miners in North Dakota,ConocoPhillips sells extra gas from oil drilling to bitcoin miners instead of burning it off in a flare.,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/15/conocophillips-is-selling-extra-gas-to-bitcoin-miners-in-north-dakota.html,"Oil and gas major ConocoPhillips is in the bitcoin mining fuel business.
The company said in a statement to CNBC on Tuesday that it has one bitcoin pilot project currently operating in the Bakken, a region in North Dakota known as an important source of new oil production in the U.S.
A representative for ConocoPhillips said the company is not operating the crypto mine itself. Instead, it sells gas that would otherwise have been burned off to a bitcoin processor that is owned and managed by a third party.
Shares of ConocoPhillips are trading around 2.5% lower as of Tuesday afternoon.
The push into bitcoin mining dovetails with an initiative by the oil and gas major to reduce routine flaring, or burning off extra gas, to zero by 2030.
The company has published reports about efforts to phase out the practice of routinely flaring natural gas in the ""Lower 48"" states, which represents the largest segment in ConocoPhillips today, based on production. It is comprised of two regions covering the Gulf Coast and Great Plains — an area that includes the Bakken.
Co-locating a bitcoin mine to an oil and gas field is a huge help toward that goal, though it won't affect the company's scope three carbon emissions, an industry term used to describe emissions that are a result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization.
For years, oil and gas companies have struggled with the problem of what to do when they accidentally hit a natural gas formation while drilling for oil. Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is right next to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. But if it's 20 miles from a pipeline, drillers often burn it off, or flare it. That is why you will typically see flames rising from oil fields.
Beyond the environmental implications of flare gas, drillers are also, in effect, burning cash.
ConocoPhillips did not disclose to CNBC which bitcoin miner it sells to, nor how long the pilot project has been underway, but what typically happens is that a company like Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems places a shipping container full of thousands of bitcoin miners on an oil well, then diverts the natural gas into generators, which convert the gas into electricity that is then used to power the miners.
The process reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared to continued flaring, according to research from Crusoe.
In a slide from a 2021 industry conference presentation by a ConocoPhillips leader, the company indicates that it has placed an ""ongoing focus"" on gas capture projects to achieve zero routine flaring of associated gas by 2025.

BTC is correcting lower, but dips might be limited below $42,800.
Bitcoin extended increase above $44,000 before it faced sellers.
The price is trading above $43,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.
There was a break below a short-term rising channel with support near $44,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).
The pair could drop to $43,000 or $42,800, where the bulls might take a stand.
Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance
Bitcoin price remained supported and extended increase above the $44,000 level. BTC even cleared the $44,500 resistance and settled above the 100 hourly simple moving average.
However, there was no test of the $45,000 resistance zone. A high was formed near $44,770 before the price started a downside correction. There was a break below the $44,500 support zone. Besides, there was a break below a short-term rising channel with support near $44,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.
Bitcoin is trading just below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $41,573 swing low to $44,770 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the broken channel support at $44,200.
The first major resistance is near the $44,500 level. A clear move above the $44,500 resistance zone might send the price further higher. The next major resistance is near $45,000, above which the price might rise towards the $45,500 resistance level.
Dips Limited in BTC?
If bitcoin fails to continue higher above the $44,500 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. An immediate support on the downside is near the $43,800 zone.
The next major support is seen near the $43,150 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $41,573 swing low to $44,770 high. If there is a downside break below the $43,850 support zone, the price might struggle. The next support sits near $42,800 or the 100 hourly SMA, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline in the near term.
Technical indicators:
Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is still above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $43,800, followed by $43,150.
Major Resistance Levels – $44,200, $44,500 and $45,500."
109,2022-02-15,2022-02-15,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Elaine Hu,cointelegraph.com,Here’s why the SEC keeps rejecting spot Bitcoin ETF applications,"Crypto investors still hope that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot-based BTC ETF one day, but data shows it has good reason not to.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-why-the-sec-keeps-rejecting-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications,"It is not the first time the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected proposals for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded product (ETP), but efforts continue to be made by different financial institutions. The recent attempt made by Cboe BZX Exchange on Jan. 25 to list the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust as a Bitcoin ETP has also failed.
The SEC letter published on Feb. 8 pointed out that the exchange has not met its burden to demonstrate the fund is “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts” and “to protect investors and the public interest.”
Although proposals of Bitcoin spot ETPs have never been approved by the SEC and such products are not available in the U.S. market, they do exist in the European market. By investigating the prices of ETPs traded in the European market, one could gain a good insight into whether fraudulent and manipulative acts are possible.
To investigate whether the SEC’s concerns of fraudulent and manipulative acts are justifiable, this article will compare the historic prices of three European listed ETPs and the Bitcoin spot price history from 18 exchanges to see if there are any significant price disparities that could induce market manipulation.
The SEC's primary concerns
There were two major concerns raised by the SEC from a technical perspective towards BZX Exchange’s proposal:
(1) No data or analysis was provided to support the argument that arbitrage across the Bitcoin platforms helps to keep global Bitcoin prices aligned with one another, thus hindering manipulation and eliminating any cross-market pricing differences. There is no indication of how closely Bitcoin prices are aligned across different Bitcoin trading venues or how quickly price disparities may be arbitraged away.
(2) The exchange does not demonstrate the proposed methodology for calculating the index would make the proposed ETP resistant to fraud or manipulation. Specifically, the exchange has not assessed the possible influence that spot platforms not included among the index’s constituent Bitcoin platforms would have on Bitcoin prices used to calculate the index.
To see if the above issues exist and whether manipulative acts are possible within the ETPs listed in the European markets, historic data (from Google Finance) of the following three ETPs listed in SIX Swiss Exchange are compared with Bitcoin spot price from exchanges (data from Cryptowatch).
WisdomTree Bitcoin ETP (BTCW-USD)
21Shares Bitcoin ETP (SWX:ABTC-USD)
Coinbase Physical BTC ETP (SWX:BITC-USD)
Correlation between Bitcoin ETPs and spot price suggest price disparities exist
As described in the proposal by BZX Exchange, the index calculation will be based on the volume-weighted median price (VWMP) in the previous five minutes from five exchanges — Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, and Kraken.
In a very simple and basic attempt to replicate the index calculation with best efforts, the daily spot prices from four out of the five aforementioned exchanges — Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken — are used.
Since the Bitcoin ETP price scale is often different from the Bitcoin spot price, the daily percentage change (or daily return) is used in all charts for easy comparison of price disparities.
The graphs below show the daily return comparison between each of the three ETPs and the aggregated Bitcoin spot price, calculated from the four exchanges using the volume-weighted median method.
The left-hand-side scatter plot shows how closely the ETP price is aligned to the spot price. If the two are perfectly aligned, all the points should fall onto the blue dash line. The right-hand-side plot compares the daily percentage return and also plots the difference between the two.
Comparing WisdomTree ETP and the spot, although most of the points in the scatter plot cluster within the +/-5% radius, there are certainly some significant price disparities outside this radius. One day during the three-month period had the daily return difference (blue dash line) between the ETP and spot price reached above 10%.

It is also interesting to note that the volatility of ETP price percentage change tends to be higher than the spot. The graph below comparing Coinbase Physical Bitcoin (blue line) and Bitcoin spot (pink line) shows the percentage change of the former could reach nearly 15% whereas the latter only went past 10%.

Similarly, 21Shares Bitcoin ETP price is also more volatile than the spot and the correlation with the spot is lower (62%) than that of WisdomTree (67%) and Coinbase Physical Bitcoin (66%).

The price comparisons shown above suggest cross-market pricing differences between the ETP price and the Bitcoin spot price from exchanges exist. The price disparities have not been arbitraged away quickly enough to prevent manipulative acts.
However, it is important to highlight that this is only a very rough comparison using the daily data. The difference in prices might be due to the different cut-off times each ETP uses to calculate the end-of-day price, i.e., exchange-traded products do not trade 24-hours like the crypto spot price; they trade during the Exchange’s regular trading hours from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm.
Also, in practice, a much higher frequency will be used to calculate the index price, i.e., the BZX Exchange proposal suggests calculating the index price using the previous five minutes data from five exchanges and updating the Intraday Indicative Value (IIV) per share every 15 seconds. The analysis done here is using only daily aggregated data to proxy the index price and might not reflect the actual index price using high-frequency data.
It is worth pointing out that although price disparities can be observed between ETPs and spot price using daily data, price discrepancies between the ETPs, themselves, are much smaller as shown in the graphs below.
Scatter plot for price disparities between ETPs. Source: Cryptowatch
It is very likely that these ETPs listed in the same exchange all use the same frequency and cut-off time to calculate their prices; hence, the price differences are smaller among themselves. This reinforces the point that the price disparities between the Bitcoin ETP and Bitcoin spot price might come from the frequency and the cut-off time used in the methodology of ETP index calculation, which can not be replicated exactly the same in this analysis.
Spot price disparities between exchanges are minimal
In the first point of concern mentioned at the beginning of the article, the SEC also asked how closely Bitcoin prices are aligned across different Bitcoin trading venues.
Based on the cross-platform BTC/USD data collected from 18 exchanges from Cryptowatch, the exchange price disparities are very small. As an example to show how closely the prices align to each other, Coinbase, Gemini and Bitstamp are compared against Kraken and the correlation between each pair is very close to 100%.
The SEC is also concerned about the possibility of price influence and manipulation from spot platforms that are not included among the index’s constituents. If Bitcoin prices from other platforms are very different from the four constituent platforms, Bitstamp, Coinbase Gemini and Kraken market manipulators might seek to exploit the disparities for profit.
To see if price disparities exist between the four platforms and others, the bottom right graph below compares the aggregated volume-weighted median price from the four platforms with the aggregated price from all 18 exchanges. The nearly perfectly aligned line shows there is almost no difference between the two. The spot platforms do not have large price disparities and the prices are closely aligned across different Bitcoin trading venues.

With such great similarity in daily prices, manipulative acts will be very difficult across exchanges. However, price manipulation could still happen intraday but it’s beyond the reach of this analysis due to lack of high-frequency intraday data.
Based on the analysis from the three SIX Swiss Exchange listed ETPs prices and the Bitcoin spot prices from 18 exchanges, it seems price disparities do exist between ETP and spot. This could potentially lead to manipulative acts towards ETP index price, even though the applicants frequently claimed the sophisticated index calculation methodology prevents such acts.
The SEC’s concerns about fraud and manipulation seems to be justified based on the price disparities between these European listed ETPs and the spot price. That said, the difference could be caused by the daily data frequency used in this analysis, which is different from the high-frequency data used in practice.
On the contrary, no significant price disparities can be found among different Bitcoin trading venues. Although the spot markets from these venues are more decentralied and less regulated than traditional stock exchanges, malicious price manipulation across these platforms could still be very difficult.
Given the large number of centralized and decentralized, regulated and unregulated crypto exchanges out there, it is extremely hard to prove price efficiency and similarity across all of them. The U.S. ETP applicants still have a long way to go to convince the SEC.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) today introduced the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act , legislation requiring a State Department report on El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, as legal tender and a plan to mitigate potential risks to the U.S. financial system.
“El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender raises significant concerns about the economic stability and financial integrity of a vulnerable U.S. trading partner in Central America,” said Risch. “This new policy has the potential to weaken U.S. sanctions policy, empowering malign actors like China and organized criminal organizations. Our bipartisan legislation seeks greater clarity on El Salvador’s policy and requires the administration to mitigate potential risk to the U.S. financial system.”
“El Salvador recognizing Bitcoin as official currency opens the door for money laundering cartels and undermines U.S. interests,” said Dr. Cassidy. “If the United States wishes to combat money laundering and preserve the role of the dollar as a reserve currency of the world, we must tackle this issue head on.”
The State Department report would require:
An analysis of El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and the risks for cybersecurity, economic stability, and democratic governance in El Salvador.
A plan to mitigate potential risks to the U.S. financial system.

The ads, featuring a bevy of celebrities and gimmicks, aimed to convince viewers that cryptocurrencies are the wave of the future.
Preying on FOMO – that is, the fear of missing out – is a classic technique of both advertisers and scam artists, so you would be forgiven for being leery of the cryptocurrency hype. But the story is more complicated than just the latest speculation craze.
Here are six stories from our archive to help you understand how cryptocurrencies work, and the bigger picture of how blockchain is setting the stage for a future in which technology, rather than institutions, guarantees ownership and fosters trust.
1. Digital money
The first question cryptocurrencies prompt is how strings of digital bits that aren’t merely placeholders for national currencies or precious metals can be real money. Who says who owns which pieces of virtual currency, and who determines what the currency is worth? The answer is no one and everyone.
“A bitcoin is as ownable as dollars are when they are deposited in a bank. Skipping the stage of physical, fungible currencies, bitcoins exist by virtue of their representations in a ledger in cyberspace,” writes the University at Buffalo’s David Koepsell.
“What bitcoin owners own is the debt, just as those who own money in banks own debts that are recorded in bits. They do not own the bits that comprise the information representing that debt, nor the information itself, they own the social object – the money – that those bits represent.”

2. Under the hood: Blockchain explained
The technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible is blockchain, a distributed digital ledger. In short, it’s a form of record keeping in which each record is spread across many computers and encrypted in a way that prevents it from being altered. Everyone can see a record but no one can change it.
“The bitcoin blockchain contains a record of every transaction in the system since its birth. This feature makes it possible to prevent account holders from reneging on transactions, even if their identities remain anonymous. Once in the ledger, a transaction is undeniable,” write Ari Juels and Ittay Eyal.
“Blockchains can be enhanced to support not just transactions, but also pieces of code known as smart contracts,” they write. “A smart contract may be viewed as playing the role of a trusted third party: Whatever task it is programmed to do, it will carry out faithfully.”
This capability opens up a wide range of possibilities for organizing life in the digital realm. As enticing as the Super Bowl ads made cryptocurrencies seem, broader uses of blockchain are arguably more significant.

3. Beyond money, part 1: Financial services
Transferring money from party A to party B is just one simple type of financial transaction. Blockchain can be used for all sorts of financial services, including loans, derivatives and insurance. This capability is dubbed decentralized finance, or DeFi.
In traditional financial services, everything depends on a financial institution, writes Kevin Werbach. “DeFi turns this arrangement on its head by re-conceiving of financial services as decentralized software applications that operate without ever taking custody of user funds.”
There are also downsides to DeFi. “Even highly mature, highly regulated traditional financial markets experience shocks and crashes because of hidden risks, as the world saw in 2008 when the global economy nearly melted down because of one obscure corner of Wall Street. DeFi makes it easier than ever to create hidden interconnections that have the potential to blow up spectacularly,” he writes.

4. Beyond money, part 2: Art
Things get interesting when you create a unique token on a blockchain and attach the token to a digital file – anything from a photo to an audio recording. The result is a file that can be uniquely identified no matter how many copies of it are made, and ownership of the file can be verified. These are nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, and they are making it easier for artists to make money from digital works – and providing another vehicle for financial speculation.
“NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in Decentraland, a virtual world,” writes Arizona State University’s Dragan Boscovic.
“The NFT market is likely to grow further because any piece of digital information can easily be ‘minted’ into an NFT, a highly efficient way of managing and securing digital assets.”

5. Beyond money, part 3: Organizations
In addition to mediating financial transactions, smart contracts can be used to set up and run organizations. Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, use the contracts to allow participants to weigh in on decisions and automate organizational functions, writes Sean Stein Smith.
“In most, if not all, instances of for-profit DAOs – or even DAOs organized for a specific one-time purpose, such as attempting to purchase an original copy of the U.S. Constitution – cash or appreciated property that is contributed to the organization is exchanged for governance tokens. The tokens essentially represent a fractional form of collective ownership,” he writes.

6. Beyond money, part 4: The metaverse
You could view the metaverse as the mother of all distributed autonomous organizations. The metaverse is a concept defining an interconnected set of virtual environments that could be a future iteration of the internet. Blockchain is what will make the interconnection possible.
“As people move between virtual worlds – say from Decentraland’s virtual environments to Microsoft’s – they’ll want to bring their stuff with them. If two virtual worlds are interoperable, the blockchain will authenticate proof of ownership of your digital goods in both virtual worlds,” write Michigan State University’s Rabindra Ratan and Dar Meshi.
Blockchain could even manage how people behave in the metaverse by making it possible to assign denizens reputation scores. “If you act like a toxic misinformation-spreading troll, you may damage your reputation and potentially have your sphere of influence reduced by the system. This could create an incentive for people to behave well in the metaverse,” they write.

Placing a ban on crypto in Russia is the “same as banning the internet, which is impossible,” Siluanov declared at the ministry’s briefing with the central bank, Forbes Russia reported Wednesday.
The finance minister reportedly said that regulating the cryptocurrency industry as soon as possible is way better than banning it as this would allow the government to finally monitor the market and grow the country's budget using taxes from crypto mining.
“What’s wrong with that, I don’t understand why it should be banned,” Siluanov said at the briefing, adding that there is an easy solution for taxing the market. According to the minister, the government should hold taxes from the realized gains on the amount of deposited and withdrawn fiat assets.
“The Central Bank wants to put an outright ban on crypto assets, arguing that this creates risks, primarily for citizens and can ‘infect’ financial institutions, banks as well as create an opaque settlement market,” Siluanov said.
He added that the finance ministry admits these concerns and thus finds it necessary to limit cryptocurrency exposure by non-professional investors as part of its concept of crypto regulation released in early February. As such, the maximum amount for inexperienced investors can be set within 50,000 Russian rubles ($660) to 100,000 rubles ($1,300), the minister reportedly said. Previously, Siluanov’s deputy Alexei Moiseev suggested limiting such purchases to $660.
The officials did not specify whether the potential limit would refer to monthly investments or any other period. The ministry's press office did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

In the meantime, the Bank of Russia does not support the idea of letting non-professional investors buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin at all, citing common risks like fraud and money laundering. The authority has also been quite hostile to crypto when it comes to mining, warning against fraud mining schemes of ""nonexistent cryptocurrencies.""
After long years of arguments, the Bank of Russia and the Russian government are expected to finally find a common ground on crypto regulation in the country by this Friday."

Ethereum currently enjoys a dominant market share in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) sectors, but this could decrease over time as challengers emerge, the report said. Prominent Ethereum competitors include Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), Solana and Cardano.
DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without using traditional middlemen. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items.
DeFi and NFTs - which constitute most of the activity on Ethereum - are subject to rapidly evolving regulations, and any new rules that restrict areas, such as finance, could see reduced demand for transactions on the network, Morgan Stanley said.
The other major Ethereum-specific risk is “blockchain bloat and scalability,” it added. As a global smart contract platform, Ethereum needs to store a huge amount of data, and the network needs to be faster and less expensive to use per transaction than its competitors, the report said.
The Ethereum network is growing faster than Bitcoin and its memory requirements have exceeded Bitcoin’s in half the time. Unless changed, its storage demand will likely outstrip its resources, the report added.
“High transaction fees create scalability problems and threaten user demand,” the analysts said, adding that high costs make the platform too expensive for small-value transactions."

Ms. Choi is a seasoned prosecutor with nearly a decade of experience within the department, and most recently served as Senior Counsel to the Deputy Attorney General. She will assume her duties full-time effective today.
“With the rapid innovation of digital assets and distributed ledger technologies, we have seen a rise in their illicit use by criminals who exploit them to fuel cyberattacks and ransomware and extortion schemes; traffic in narcotics, hacking tools and illicit contraband online; commit thefts and scams; and launder the proceeds of their crimes,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The NCET will serve as the focal point for the department’s efforts to tackle the growth of crime involving these technologies. Eun Young is an accomplished leader on cyber and cryptocurrency issues, and I am pleased that she will continue her service as the NCET’s inaugural Director, spearheading the department’s efforts in this area.”
The NCET was established to ensure the department meets the challenge posed by the criminal misuse of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and comprises attorneys from across the department, including prosecutors with backgrounds in cryptocurrency, cybercrime, money laundering and forfeiture. The NCET will identify, investigate, support and pursue the department’s cases involving the criminal use of digital assets, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, infrastructure providers, and other entities that are enabling the misuse of cryptocurrency and related technologies to commit or facilitate criminal activity. The NCET will set strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identify areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and lead the department’s efforts to coordinate with domestic and international law enforcement partners, regulatory agencies and private industry to combat the criminal use of digital assets. Finally, the NCET will enhance the Criminal Division’s existing efforts to provide support and training to federal, state, local, and international law enforcement to build capacity to aggressively investigate and prosecute serious crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets in the United States and around the world.
The NCET’s work will be furthered through close collaboration with components across the department, including the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section; the U.S. Attorneys’ offices; the National Security Division; and the FBI, including the FBI’s new Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit, a specialized team of cryptocurrency experts dedicated to providing analysis, support, and training across the FBI, as well as innovating its cryptocurrency tools to stay ahead of future threats.
“The department has been at the forefront of investigating and prosecuting crimes involving digital currencies since their inception,” said Director Choi. “The NCET will play a pivotal role in ensuring that as the technology surrounding digital assets grows and evolves, the department in turn accelerates and expands its efforts to combat their illicit abuse by criminals of all kinds. I am excited to lead the NCET’s incredible and talented team of attorneys, and to get to work on this important priority for the department. I would like to thank Assistant Attorney General Polite and the Criminal Division’s leadership for this opportunity.”
Prior to her service as Senior Counsel to Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco, Director Choi began her career at the department as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where she served as the office’s Cybercrime Coordinator and investigated and prosecuted cyber, complex fraud and money laundering crimes, with a particular focus on network intrusions, digital currency, the dark web and national security investigations. She served as lead prosecutor in a variety of cases, including the investigation of a transnational organization responsible for the hacking of J.P. Morgan Chase and a dozen other financial companies; the operation of Coin.mx, an unlicensed virtual currency exchange; and the only U.S. prosecution brought in connection with the “Panama Papers.” In addition, she successfully argued the appeal before the Second Circuit in the case against Ross Ulbricht, the founder and chief administrator of the Silk Road, the first darknet marketplace. Earlier in her career, she served as a law clerk to the Honorable Naomi Reice Buchwald of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the Honorable Reena Raggi of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School."

At this point, many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have become almost mainstream and are household names. There are more options to buy cryptocurrencies",https://interestingengineering.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-in-2022,"How to bitcoin in 2022: There are more options than ever. Here is where to start.
The pandemic has accelerated the rise of a cashless economy. While the years leading up to it saw customers adopting new digital payment habits, such as an increasing preference for contactless payments and online card payments. For example, less than one in five Singaporeans now prefer using cash to electronic payment options in Singapore.
The benefits of digital payment systems are aplenty, such as instant payments and increased security. Still, they can spell trouble for those without a bank account or the elderly population, most of whom rely on cash for everyday payments.
Regardless, for better or worse, there is an abundance of evidence indicating that the world is moving closer to a near-universal uptake of e-wallets and electronic payments, with some reports claiming that 50 percent of the world's population will be using mobile wallets by 2025.
This growth in cashless payments is also paving the way for increased use of cryptocurrency, with the number of crypto users worldwide crossing 300 million in 2021.
At this point, many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have become almost mainstream and are household names. Crypto can be traded from practically any place in the world.
What exactly is cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital payment system that does not rely on banks to verify transactions. Unlike fiat currencies regulated by a central monetary authority such as a government or bank, cryptocurrencies are decentralized and remain free of third-party oversight. This also means that cryptocurrency transactions are virtually untraceable - a boon to anyone who wants their financial transactions to remain completely private.
Unlike fiat currencies, which use physical money, those who own cryptocurrencies do not hold anything tangible, like a dollar bill or a coin. They own a digital key that allows a record or a unit of measure to be moved from one person to another.

Instead of guarantees offered by a third party, cryptocurrencies are underpinned by a distributed public ledger called the blockchain. This is essentially a record of transactions. Units of cryptocurrency are created through mining, which involves using computers to solve complicated mathematical problems that validate transactions and generate tokens. Users can also buy cryptocurrencies using fiat money then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.
Cryptocurrencies use complex cryptographic protocols that encrypt sensitive data transfers. These are difficult to duplicate or counterfeit due to the advanced coding and mathematical principles that serve as the backbone of the aforementioned protocols. These same protocols also conceal the identities of cryptocurrency users, which makes it challenging to attribute transactions to specific individuals or groups. Further, these transactions are vetted by a technology called a blockchain.

When you transfer cryptocurrency funds from your digital wallet, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger.
What is blockchain technology, and how does it work?

Cryptocurrency is underpinned by blockchain technology. It records and stores all transactions and activity, thereby validating the units of the currency. Decentralization is the core principle of a blockchain. Without a centralized authority, a network of peers uses a consensus method to validate transactions.
Imagine one of the world's largest banks storing all of their client data across a couple of servers at a single location. The chances of a single point of failure are highly possible here. What if its Internet connection is severed? What if the electricity at that location goes out? Data could be lost.
Here, a blockchain spreads the data held in that database among various network nodes at different locations.

Nodes can be any device, such as computers or servers, and form the backbone of a blockchain. Nodes exchange blockchain data with each other. This is where the transaction history of the blockchain is stored.
Once a request for a transaction is made, a 'block' representing the transaction is created and sent to every node on the network. The nodes then compete to validate the transaction. This is done using complex algorithms. Once validated, the block is added to the existing blocks, forming a chain. The process of authenticating and completing a block is known as ""mining.""
Once the update is transmitted across the network, the transaction is completed. All transactions on the blockchain are secured using a cryptographic technique called hashing. This uses complex algorithms to convert data into a string of characters (called the ""hash""). In cryptocurrency, each time a hash is mined and a block is added to the ledger. The ""miner"" also earns a token, or part of a token, such as a Bitcoin.

A cryptocurrency transaction needs to be added to the blockchain to be finalized. The process, which occurs within minutes, is usually irreversible.
Blockchains attempt to be an alternative to traditional centralized financial companies - where all the power and decisions rest in the hands of a few. Entities like DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and concepts such as On-Chain Governance make it more democratic; it is not just the developers and the miners who make decisions anymore; the users get their say. However, a significant portion of cryptocurrency holders see it as an investment. More on this later.
But before we proceed further, here's a dime-sized history lesson.
Tracing the history
In 1982, American computer scientist David Chaum developed a ""blind signature"" system. This is a way of separating a person's identity from their financial transaction to create an untraceable payment system. His anonymous cryptographic electronic money was called eCash. Years later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash, an early cryptographic electronic payment.

Forward to 1996. The National Security Agency published a paper titled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, which described a cryptocurrency system. Two years later, in 1998, computer engineer Wei Dai published a description of ""b-money,"" an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. That same year, computer scientist and cryptographer Nicholas Szabo designed Bit Gold, a decentralized digital currency.
Years later, in 2007, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym for the person or group who developed Bitcoin, stated that work on writing the code for Bitcoin began. In 2008, Nakamoto published a white paper describing digital cryptography, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. In early January 2009, Nakamoto released version 0.1 of the Bitcoin software and launched the network by defining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.

Nakamoto continued to work with other developers on the Bitcoin software. In 2011, Nakamoto handed over control of the source code repository and network alert key to developer Gavin Andresen, who became the project lead.
How does cryptocurrency get its value?
Cryptocurrencies gain value based on user demand, the coin's utility, or scarcity. Cryptocurrencies in high demand tend to surge and push prices up. Also, some factors of crypto value stem from the image and efficiency of private blockchain-related corporations that issue digital coins.
Some cryptocurrencies have a maximum supply: no new coins will be mined or produced once this supply is exhausted. For example, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, which means no one can mine, create, print or issue more coins once this threshold has been reached.
How do I invest in cryptocurrency?
It can be tempting to buy a few coins just because your friends are loading up on the hottest new crypto. However, fad buying comes with risks, as prices could plummet the next day. As a result, it pays to research before you invest and find your fit among the hundreds of cryptocurrencies.
Beginner cryptocurrency investors should make the wise choice to stick to the well-established cryptocurrencies out there, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum, is the most popular cryptocurrency with an overall track record of increasing value over time.
You'll also come across cryptocurrencies that have little or no value, known as meme coins. Memes and internet jokes inspire these cryptocurrencies. The Dogecoin is a popular meme coin, which was inspired by the Doge meme created from a viral photo of a Shiba Inu dog. Once meme coins get popular, retail investors can boost the currency further.
Celebrities and prominent figures can also accelerate the popularity of the coin. For example, Elon Musk's tweets and posts often move markets and drive up the demand for various cryptocurrencies.
Some cryptocurrencies have been created to scam people out of money. A Squid Game-based token arrived on the market shortly after the Netflix series became popular. It increased in value to a peak of over USD 2,800 per coin before the creators sold off their units and disappeared with everyone's money. Crypto investors call this kind of scam a ""rug pull.""
Choosing an exchange
Once you've decided on a cryptocurrency, you need to open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange.
They are platforms of cryptocurrency exchanges that facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies for assets that include digital and fiat currencies. Some cryptocurrency exchanges include Coinbase, Bittrex, Binance, and Kraken.
Coinbase, perhaps the most reputable platform, enables Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash trades. The exchange is secure and ideal for beginners. However, it has very few cryptocurrencies, and advanced traders may not find it flexible enough. Bittrex has 200 trading pairs and is suitable for big trades. China-based exchange Binance charges very low transaction fees, offers varieties of coins, and has advanced interfaces that are user-friendly for both beginners and advanced traders. However, there is uncertainty on how changing regulations in China could impact it. Kraken, too offers a lot of varieties like Zcash and Ripple. The platform allows the user to trade between Bitcoin and USD, Euros, Canadian Dollars, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. However, it is less user-friendly when compared to other popular platforms.
In an interview with Forbes, Stephen McKeon, an associate professor of finance at the University of Oregon, said, ""Important features to consider are fees, security, and whether they list the assets that you are interested in buying.""
Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.
Crypto wallets are software that store the private keys to your cryptocurrencies securely. Some exchanges provide wallet services, making it easy to keep your cryptocurrencies securely.
The wallet works by a random number being generated. It is used with the length of the algorithm size of the cryptocurrency's technology requirements. This number is then converted to a private key as per the requirements of the cryptography algorithm requirement. A public key is then generated from the private key.
The owner utilizes this private key to access and send cryptocurrency. While the private key remains personal to the user, the public key is shared during the cryptocurrency transaction.
You need to ensure that the exchange and wallet you want to use also supports the cryptocurrency you want to buy.
Funding your account and placing orders
Once you've chosen your platform, you need to fund your account. Most crypto exchanges allow users to purchase cryptocurrency using fiat currencies.
Once you've sufficient fiat currency in your account, you can place your order to buy cryptocurrency. Your buy order will be matched to someone making a sell order at the same price. The exchange will then make the trade, held in the wallet.
You can also use payment services like PayPal and Venmo to invest in crypto.
However, crypto is volatile, and you need to be prepared for it. Price fluctuations within a few hours are highly common.
What is crypto mining?
In the most basic sense, Crypto mining is a way of creating new coins. However, it also involves authenticating cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger.
The digital ledger automatically updates when someone spends cryptocurrency by crediting one account and debiting the other. Distributed ledgers like that of Bitcoin only allow verified miners to update transactions. New coins are generated to such miners, known as ""block reward"". A proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol ensures that only verified crypto miners can mine and validate transactions.
And now, the most critical question. What can you buy with cryptocurrency?
As we mentioned earlier, though cryptocurrency was intended to purchase goods and services, such transactions are rare, and most people use it as an investment. Still, it is possible to buy various goods from e-commerce websites using crypto. Here are a few examples.
Technology and E-commerce sites
Several companies like AT&T, Microsoft, Twitch, and newegg.com sell tech products that accept crypto. Shopify and Home Depot also accept crypto. E-commerce platform Overstock was one of the first sites to accept Bitcoin.
Insurance
Last April, Swiss insurer AXA announced that it had begun accepting Bitcoin. Premier Shield Insurance, which sells home and auto insurance policies in the US, also accepts Bitcoin for premium payments.
Restaurants and supermarkets
Some Subway, Burger King, and Whole Foods outlets accept cryptocurrency. Need we say more?
Luxury goods
Some luxury retailers accept crypto. For example, crypto-only luxury retailers sell Rolex and Patek Philippe.
Cars
Some car dealers like AutoCoinCars and BitCars sell cars and list their prices in Bitcoin.
Sounds great but wait. Is it legal in our countries?
The outlook of countries and regulators has varied over the years; while some have declared a total ban, many have allowed them to operate with some regulations, and a few have permitted trading in the absence of any framework. While El Salvador has approved Bitcoin as legal tender, China has imposed stringent regulations on cryptocurrencies and their service providers. In the USA, the definitions and rules vary according to the state. However, the federal government does not recognize them as legal tender. Other countries, like India, are working on policies to regulate cryptos.
As per the latest news, the Russian government has decided to integrate the circulation of cryptocurrencies into Russia's financial system,
Okay... It's environment-friendly, though. Right?
Not quite. Bitcoin's decentralized structure is the marker of its vast carbon emissions footprint. The reason? Bitcoin uses computers to solve its complex math problems, the backbone referred to as a ""proof-of-work"" system. ""In the case of Bitcoin, this is done by having many different competitors all conduct a race to see how quickly they can package the transactions and solve a small mathematical problem,"" Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at EY, told Forbes. This will only accelerate with more people entering the fray. All of this computing comes at a considerable energy cost.
Can this be combated? As per this Forbes article, an estimated 39 percent of proof-of-work mining is done using renewable energy. Innumerable startups like Genesis Mining in Iceland have begun to increase that figure.
""However, unless cryptocurrencies move from proof-of-work systems to ""proof of stake"" systems that don't require 'this same mad dash to solve puzzles,' the former verification technology is wasteful,"" says Simon Peters, eToro cryptocurrency market analyst.
Proof-of-stake (PoS) requires miners to put a small amount of cryptocurrency to be entered into a lottery for the opportunity to verify transactions. ""Because proof-of-stake systems remove the competitive computational element of proof-of-work, it saves energy and allows each machine in a PoS to work on one problem at a time, as opposed to a PoW system, in which an array of machines are rushing to solve the same problem (thus wasting energy),"" said Peters.
Currently, Ethereum has plans to transition to a proof-of-stake system.
Some cryptos have also introduced pre-mining to avoid the computing involved in solving math puzzles to earn digital currencies. ""Several other crypto-assets like XRP [also popularly referred to as Ripple] weren't mined at all but were instead produced algorithmically,"" said Peters. ""This eliminates the need for dedicated high-speed mining equipment.""
Is investing in cryptocurrency for everyone? Well, there's a considerable risk involved, considering its volatile nature, and your daily dose of crypto news can be nerve-racking. Even small ripples such as a tweet can see their values soar and dip. So, if you're a conservative investor, you may not want to lay your hands on this. But it sure looks like the way ahead."
117,2022-02-17,2022-02-17,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Decrypt,Andrew Hayward",decrypt.co,"Bitcoin, Ethereum and Other Top Coins Fall as Crypto Market Stumbles","Bitcoin, Ethereum, and much of the market is red right now amid geopolitical tension and increased law enforcement scrutiny on crypto.",https://decrypt.co/93191/bitcoin-ethereum-top-coins-fall-crypto-market-down,"In brief The cryptocurrency market is down about 7% over the last 24 hours.
Bitcoin and Ethereum have both seen losses around 8% each, while others have fallen even harder during the span.
The cryptocurrency market is largely in the red today as leading coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are both down several percentage points in value over the last 24 hours.
Bitcoin is down nearly 8% over that span, per data from CoinMarketCap, after experiencing the largest single-day drop for the leading cryptocurrency in almost a month—since January 21. The market had largely recovered since that date and Bitcoin is still up 10% over the past 14 days, but the price has tumbled in recent hours.
Edward Moya, OANDA senior market analyst for the Americas, wrote in emailed comments that the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has spurred Wall Street to tighten its belt—with the impact being felt in Bitcoin’s price today, as well. Bitcoin sits at $40,732 as of this writing.
“Wall Street has gone full de-risking mode and Bitcoin is paying the price,” wrote Moya. “Fears over geopolitical concerns and potentially aggressive central bank tightening has cryptos across the board in freefall.”
Prices may also be impacted by the threat of increased governmental scrutiny in the United States, as the FBI today announced a new crypto crimes division, while the Department of Justice named the first director for its recently-established National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.
Ethereum has seen a slightly more significant tumble during the same span, down more than 8% in 24 hours. At a price of $2,895, Ethereum is now about 41% off its all-time peak of $4,892 set in November 2021, according to CoinMarketCap.
It’s not just the top two coins that are down today, either. Most of the market is red right now, falling about 7% with a total cryptocurrency market cap of just over $1.8 trillion as of this writing.
Solana is down 8% at a current price of $94, for example, with Terra, Polkadot, and Shiba Inu showing roughly the same percentage losses over the past 24 hours. Larger stumbles in the top 100 by market cap include social token platform Rally, down nearly 21% today, with Filecoin and Theta both dropping about 12% each in 24 hours."

Fed teases over rate hikes
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD acting in a slightly widened zone with $44,500 as a ceiling over the past 24 hours.
The pair had returned to the top of its intraday range overnight on the back of United States Federal Reserve comments.
Expected to provide cues about potential interest rate hikes, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from a meeting in late January ultimately provided few surprises. A hike could come in March, but no firm commitment was voiced over the process.
“The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run,” an accompanying statement read.
“In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.”
The FOMC added that it was aiming to halt asset purchases altogether in March, in line with previous plans, with February’s purchases due to amount to at least $30 billion.
With little in the way of fresh news, crypto markets were thus uninspiring going into Thursday. Zooming out, however, optimism was still firmly present on the strength of the past two weeks’ BTC price action.
“My bias has changed a bit and now favor a squeeze towards 53k before mid March,” popular trader and analyst Pentoshi said as part of his latest Twitter update.
Others likewise noted the comparatively robust price performance this month compared to previous episodes in Bitcoin’s comedown from all-time highs last November.
By bouncing at near $33,000 in January, for example, a miner capitulation event — where miners are forced to sell or stop mining altogether due to Bitcoin’s spot price being less than their cost of production — was successfully avoided.
Like I have said for the past week for #Bitcoin; no reason to panic until support failed, no reason to be too excited until resistance breaks

As Cointelegraph reported, support levels were creeping up throughout recent days as buyers bet on a potential dip being less shallow than previously expected.
Russia tensions persist for stocks, crypto
Other macro signals on the day came in the form of fresh uncertainty over the Russia–Ukraine saga, with reports of hostilities emerging overnight.

Earlier, the U.S. government called claims that Russia was attempting to de-escalate the situation on the Ukrainian border — something that would have conversely steaded nervous markets — “false.”
“Yesterday, the Russian government said it was withdrawing troops from the border of Ukraine... we now know it was false,” a senior official said on Wednesday quoted by the Financial Times.

Fidelity International has launched a physical bitcoin exchange traded product in response to a growing demand for digital assets among European investors.
The product launch comes three months after Invesco brought its own bitcoin ETP to the market amid a growing willingness by large asset managers to enter the cryptocurrency arena.
Fidelity’s Physical Bitcoin ETP, which will be available to professional and institutional investors in Europe, is domiciled in Germany and listed on Xetra in Frankfurt. The product will start trading on Zurich’s Six in the coming weeks.
Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital assets arm of US-based Fidelity Investments, will act as custodian for the ETP.
Nick King, head of exchange traded funds at the $813bn asset manager, said the launch was an “important evolution” in his company’s ETP offering and the first step in its “digital assets product capability”.
This article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group.
The ETP has an ongoing charges figure of 0.75 per cent and launched with about $6mn of assets.
Christian Staub, managing director for Europe at Fidelity, said the ETP’s “underlying distributed ledger technology has the potential to revolutionise the financial system over time and disrupt many parts of the financial world with profound implications for investors”.
A recent survey conducted by Fidelity Digital Assets showed that 70 per cent of institutional investors expected to buy or invest in digital assets “in the near future”.
More than 90 per cent of respondents who said they were interested in digital assets expected to have an allocation to the asset class within the next five years.
The launch comes after Fidelity Digital Assets was granted official registration status with the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, for its digital assets custody and trade execution business late last year.
The digital assets arm of Fidelity Investments was previously listed as a temporary member on the register of the FCA but it has now been moved to the watchdog’s permanent register.
Fidelity Digital Assets initially launched its digital assets services for institutional investors in the US but established a European outpost in London in late 2019.
In early December, Fidelity Investments launched a Canadian-domiciled physical bitcoin ETF, which has $30mn in assets.

120,2022-02-18,2022-02-18,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Oliver Milman,www.theguardian.com,Bitcoin miners revived a dying coal plant - then CO2 emissions soared,Critics say the enormous electricity consumption needed to sustain cryptocurrency is fueling the climate crisis and now threatens a partial resurrection of coal in the US,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/18/bitcoin-miners-revive-fossil-fuel-plant-co2-emissions-soared,"Environmentalists in Montana called it the “death watch”. Following years of financial losses one of the handful of remaining coal-fired power plants in the state appeared doomed, its likely fate offering a small but noteworthy victory in the effort to avoid disastrous climate change. But then a bitcoin mining company stepped in to resurrect it.
The Hardin generating station, a 115-megawatt coal plant located a dozen miles from the historic site of the famous battle of Little Big Horn in southern Montana, was slated for closure in 2018 due to a lack of customers only to somehow limp on, operating on just 46 days in 2020. “We were just waiting for this thing to die,” said Anne Hedges, co-director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “They were struggling and looking to close. It was on the brink. And then this cryptocurrency company came along.”
In a deal struck in late 2020, Marathon, a bitcoin “mining” company, became the sole recipient of the power station’s electricity. It established an elongated data center on 20 acres of land beside the facility that is packed with more than 30,000 Antminer S19 units, a specialized computer that mines for bitcoin. Such thirst for power is common in crypto – globally bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than Norway, a country of 5.3 million people.
As the bitcoin miners moved in last year, Hardin roared back to life. In the first nine months of 2021 alone, the plant’s boilers fired up on 236 separate days. Planet-heating emissions from the burning of Hardin’s coal soared too, with 187,000 tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the second quarter of last year, more than 5000% more than was expelled in the same period in 2020.
In the third quarter, a further 206,000 tons of CO2 was emitted, a 905% increase on 2020, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows. Hardin was operating at “near full capacity”, Marathon said in a December update, with the data center producing around 34 bitcoin on 1 December.
“I was horrified to see it all happen, it was a terrible turn of events,” said Hedges, who took to visiting the plant and photographing the new data center as it took shape, fans perched on its roof to help cool the humming computer hardware. “This isn’t helping old ladies from freezing to death, it’s to enrich a few people while destroying our climate for all of us. If you’re concerned about climate change you should have nothing to do with cryptocurrency, it’s a disaster for the climate.”
Hardin is part of a wave of America’s “zombie” fossil fuel plants that have been brought back from the dead by cryptocurrency companies looking to feed the insatiable energy demands of their mining operations. China, formerly the epicenter of the bitcoin industry, effectively banished around half of the world’s currency miners last year and the resulting search for cheap power has seen companies eye struggling US power stations.
In 2020, a mothballed coal plant in upstate New York was converted to run on gas and power a large-scale bitcoin mining operation, a move that owner Greenidge Generation said is “bringing a piece of the world’s digital future” to the state. Eric Adams, the new New York City mayor who said he would accept his first paycheck in bitcoin, last week criticised the environmental impact of crypto mining.
Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, thousands of bitcoin mining computers have been packed in shipping containers alongside the Scrubgrass plant, which burns waste coal and was set to close before pivoting to bitcoin. And in Kentucky, a new bitcoin facility is being built next to the Big Rivers Electric Corporation, which owns and operates four coal-fired power plants.

This tactic, crypto firms argue, generates local jobs – Kentucky aimed to lure currency miners by passing a law that exempts them from an electricity sales tax – and uses up excess power without straining the grid for homes and businesses. But critics point out that the enormous electricity consumption needed to sustain the virtual currency is fueling the climate crisis and now threatens a partial resurrection of coal in the US.
“Coal and natural gas power plants used for crypto mining that would otherwise be sunsetting as we decarbonize adds yet more carbon to the atmosphere in an era when we should be cutting such emissions,” said Benjamin Jones, a specialist in natural resource economics at the University of New Mexico. “Crypto’s continued or expanding use of fossil fuel sourced electricity imposes significant environmental economic costs on society.”
Jones said it is “troubling” to see that bitcoin’s already huge energy consumption is increasing and that most of this is coming from fossil fuels, despite some efforts by mining companies to increase the amount of clean energy they use – Marathon, the company that draws power from Hardin, has struck a separate agreement in Texas to take power from a wind farm.
Even some early champions of bitcoin have balked at its energy use, with Elon Musk last year halting Tesla’s use of the crypto currency because, he said, the electric vehicle company is “concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel”. Uber, the ride-hailing service, has said it won’t accept crypto payments until the climate impacts are reduced.

A little more than a decade ago, it was possible to mine bitcoins with a single computer at home, using a negligible amount of electricity. The ultimate supply of bitcoins was limited and new bitcoins were awarded to those who could help validate transactions – the miners.
The process of validation essentially involves playing a giant guessing game that gets more difficult the more miners participate. As interest in bitcoin has soared, fast, powerful computers, packed in warehouses, now have a better chance of winning the guessing game and being rewarded with several bitcoins, which are currently worth around $42,000 each.
This race for bitcoin wealth gobbles up an enormous amount of electricity – around 0.5% of total global consumption. The energy used to mine bitcoin every 60 seconds would be enough to power the average American household for 17 years, while the annual electricity consumption for mining would be able to power all kettles used to boil water for tea in the UK for 28 years.
While this usage has been criticized by climate activists, bitcoin miners claim it should be put in a different context. Fred Thiel, chief executive of Marathon, said that the movement of physical goods around the world, and even the use of washing machines in the US, uses more energy than bitcoin. “I understand the desire for some people to point bitcoin mining as the big bad boy, but on a comparison with every other industry out there, it’s insignificant,” he said in an interview.
Thiel likens bitcoin mining to the transactions processed in data centers by companies such as Amazon and Google and claimed that the industry is moving quickly towards renewable energy – Marathon plans to phase out its use of coal next year – after finding its options were limited when miners had to quickly shift away from China.
“Go back to 2020, renewable companies weren’t offering energy to bitcoin miners,” said Thiel. “Very few people wanted to even deal with bitcoin miners in the energy world. And so bitcoin miners spent time looking for stranded assets. And so the only way for us to mine was to find stranded energy, which we did in finding the Hardin plant.”
It remains to be seen if bitcoin will make a significant move away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime it will likely come under increasing scrutiny over its appetite for fossil fuel-powered electricity. “We simply don’t know how emissions from bitcoin mining will look in five to 10 years,” said Jones, the University of New Mexico professor. “It seems likely, though, it will to continue to be a major consumer of energy going forward.”"

Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have continued to rise in profile, including as a method to pay for goods and services in the mooted next generation of the internet, Web3. But as more money pours into the so-far loosely regulated currencies, government scrutiny is also increasing.
On 17 February, the US Justice Department announced that it was launching a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team designed to monitor blockchains, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, for any ill-gotten gains. It will work with various groups, including the FBI’s newly launched Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit, which also focuses on cryptocurrency.
“With the rapid innovation of digital assets and distributed ledger technologies, we have seen a rise in their illicit use by criminals who exploit them to fuel cyberattacks and ransomware and extortion schemes; traffic in narcotics, hacking tools and illicit contraband online; commit thefts and scams; and launder the proceeds of their crimes,” said Kenneth Polite Jr at the US Justice Department in a statement.

The news comes weeks after the Justice Department charged a couple with laundering bitcoins worth $4.5 billion – and just after the UK tax authority, HMRC, announced its first seizure of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital assets that are paid for with cryptocurrencies. In January, a New Scientist investigation revealed that UK police forces have seized £300 million in bitcoin in the past five years.
Taken together, it seems to add up to a cryptocurrency crackdown. “This is excellent news for anyone who has been watching the space for a long time, and is long overdue,” says Andres Guadamuz at the University of Sussex, UK. “There’s always been fraud in crypto indeed, but I think that there is growing concern about the scale of some of the frauds.”
While there are many legitimate uses for the technology, cryptocurrencies are also used for money laundering. A recent analysis of 29 unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges, where people can trade the currencies, found that up to 70 per cent of cryptocurrency trades were “wash trading” – where an investor sells and buys the same asset to create artificial interest in an investment, often distorting the price. That research studied exchanges up to 2019. A more recent analysis, conducted by blockchain data platform Chainalysis, estimates that at least $25 billion of cryptocurrency held on exchanges is from illicit sources. That compares with estimates of money laundered every year worldwide of between $800 billion and $2 trillion.

“The FBI, along with many other law enforcement agencies, have made no bones about the fact that they see cryptocurrency – and bitcoin in particular – as the favoured means of monetising crimes, especially the ever-increasing scourge of ransomware,” says Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey, UK.
At the same time, cryptocurrencies have broken out from being an online niche to something seen as a more mainstream investment. Large cryptocurrency exchanges ran adverts featuring Hollywood stars during the Super Bowl on 13 February, one of the world’s most-watched sporting events, which was viewed by 112 million people.
While cryptocurrency exchanges are legitimate businesses, the increased prominence of the technology makes it easier for people to fall victim to illegitimate scams. “Cryptocurrency scams and other crimes are impacting more and more people in a plethora of different ways,” says Matthew Shillito at the University of Liverpool, UK. In May 2021, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said it saw a 12-fold increase in numbers, and 1000 per cent rise in value, of reported cryptocurrency scams, compared with a year before. The volume of scams rose significantly throughout 2020 and 2021, the FTC said.
In a sense, the creation of the NCET is an acknowledgement that cryptocurrencies are set to play an increasingly important role in the US economy, and therefore must be policed as such. “The instability and fraud have been tolerated until now, but as more and more people sink their savings into crypto, the danger of collapse is more real,” says Guadamuz."

Bitcoin prices fell to less than $40,00 today, consistently fluctuating south of that level and reaching their lowest in roughly two weeks.
The world’s most prominent digital currency dropped below $40,000 around 9:30 a.m. EST, before declining to as little as $39,477.09 around 11 a.m. EST, CoinDesk figures show.
This latest downward movement took place after the cryptocurrency fell sharply yesterday, suffering its largest intraday loss since January 21.
After depreciating to its recent low of $39,477.09, bitcoin bounced back, surpassing $40,400 in less than an hour, but once again moved lower, repeatedly reaching points below $40,000.
[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]
Global Political Uncertainty
When describing bitcoin’s recent price weakness, several experts highlighted how political uncertainty affected the markets.
Ben McMillan, CIO at IDX Digital Assets, spoke to these developments, describing yesterday’s downward price movement as “largely a technical sell-off on the back of continued uncertainty about Ukraine as well as the President's executive order on crypto regulation.”
Ben Armstrong, founder of BitBoy Crypto, also weighed in, stating that “the instability around the Ukrainian-Russian border has led to a drop in the Bitcoin price.”
“This could be a sign of fundamental stress on the price of Bitcoin as opposed to a purely technical move,” he added.
Key Technical Levels
In addition to shedding light on what caused bitcoin’s recent price movements, several experts provided technical analysis, outlining key levels of support and resistance that bitcoin might encounter.
Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment data provider Trade The Chain, spoke to this matter.
“Bitcoin technical analysis shows key liquidity levels at $38,700 and $37,000, meaning there is a lot of buy interest at those levels. If Bitcoin is unable to hold $40,000, it is likely to test those levels into the weekend.”
Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, also contributed input.
“I think there are two major levels to watch out for on the downside. The first level is the low from this current correction, which bottomed on January 24th just under $33,000,” he stated.
“Another major level would be around $30,000, which has served as a major support level since early 2021. A break of this ~$30,000 support level could suggest another major downturn.”
Sifling also spoke to resistance levels, noting that “For bulls to regain control, we’d like to see a base build at or above the $50,000 level before making a move towards $60,000 and then all time highs.”
McMillan commented on some potential resistance, stating that “Bitcoin is trading between the key levels of $40k and $45k and a breakout on either side would likely be followed by a sustained move in that direction.”
William Noble, the chief technical analyst of research platform Token Metrics, spoke to the head and shoulders pattern, a kind of chart formation that frequently points to a trend reversal.
“There is a very clear head and shoulders top on the bitcoin daily chart. The pattern was confirmed by the failed rally to 45k and subsequent decline,” he stated.
“The next big levels are 36,700 and 34,000. 36,700 was the takeoff point of the most recent up move that stopped near 45k.”
Noble also mentioned further price levels that could provide key support.
“34k is an interesting point as well. Back in July 2021, 34k was the high the week of the final big down week of that correction,” he stated.
“BTC may bounce in a big way off that level. Using Fibonacci extension work, it is possible bitcoin falls to 28k, especially if the stock market bubble pops.”
Bitcoin’s Short-Term Outlook
Tim Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management, spoke to the key variables affecting bitcoin’s price, as well as what they could mean for the digital currency’s outlook in the near future.
“While $40k is an important level psychologically, there is really nothing magic about it,” he noted.
“Even though the news has been generally good in the crypto space recently, the truly annoying high recent correlation with the SPX, coupled with geopolitical concerns focused around the pending (and seemingly inevitable) Russian invasion of Ukraine, is putting pressure on BTC for really no fundamental reason,” said Enneking.
“That pressure hurts three primary theses of BTC: (1) safe haven, (2) non-correlated, and (3) inflation hedge.”
“The crypto optimist in me says that, once the invasion of Ukraine takes place, the price will drop (with fiat equity markets), but then recover more quickly and much harder than fiat markets. That remains to be seen, however.”

124,2022-02-18,2022-02-18,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Anders Bylund,www.fool.com,Why Cryptocurrency-Related Investments Like Coinbase and Bitcoin Are Struggling Today,Leading cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks struggle amid military drama and economic challenges on a global level.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/02/18/why-cryptocurrency-investments-are-down-today/,"What happened
Cryptocurrencies headed lower at the end of this week. The total value of the crypto market fell 4.8% in 24 hours and 9.3% in two days, as of 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday. Most of the major digital currencies showed similar downtrends. The 24-hour chart for Bitcoin (BTC 2.85%) pointed 4.3% lower while Ethereum (ETH 4.17%) displayed a 5.9% haircut and Solana (SOL 1.70%) suffered a 6% drop. The negative mojo also drove crypto-related stocks lower. For example, shares of the cryptocurrency trading platform operator Coinbase Global (COIN 4.30%) were down 3.2%, having recovered from an even deeper dip of 5.9% earlier in the day.
So what
The chief reason behind these cryptocurrency price drops is found in Ukraine, where Russian troops are gathering around the country's border and many observers fear there could be a full-scale invasion any day now. Ukraine holds a strategically important position on the map, affecting Russia's access to Mediterranean and trans-European trade routes. In particular, Ukraine's Crimean peninsula controls the flow of Russian oil and natural gas into crucial export markets. If this tension erupts into an actual invasion, the resulting effects on the global economy would be unpredictable but almost certainly not good.
On top of that high-strung situation in international politics, the U.S. government is grappling with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Interest rates will soon show significant increases for the first time in decades, undermining the value of growth-oriented assets such as cryptocurrencies.
And that's not all. The Biden administration is working up an executive order directly aimed at the cryptocurrency sector, ordering agencies such as the Department of Treasury, the Justice Department, and the Department of Homeland Security to investigate these digital assets in preparation for a firm regulatory framework. Nobody knows exactly what this executive order will look like, and it's even harder to predict its long-term effects on the crypto market.
Investors generally hate uncertainty, and there's a lot of that going around right now. That's why cryptocurrency prices and related stock charts are pointing downward right now.
Now what
The Ukrainian tension and the shaky economy are certainly worrisome, with the concerns running far wider than the cryptocurrency sector. A major setback in either one of these situations could trigger another global recession, weighing on everything from stocks and crypto coins to personal income rates and manufacturing activity. These downturns are bound to happen every once in a while, and the explosive mix of risk factors on the table seem to be driving the markets in that direction as we speak.
At the same time, no recession lasts forever and there will be brighter days ahead. Selling your stocks and cryptocurrencies during a downturn is an effective way to convert your paper losses into lost cash. It's better to stay calm during times of panic and take advantage of the lower prices as appropriate.
For instance, Ethereum is going through a series of technology upgrades that will put its blockchain network in a stronger competitive position for the long haul. Solana is finding more interest in its high-speed smart contracts every day, inspiring investors and developers to build non-fungible token (NFT) markets and decentralized finance applications on this platform. Bitcoin's role as a long-term value store looks more sustainable than ever, and I think we'd see digital assets playing an important role in the long-term recovery from the next worldwide economic setback. Oh, and a solid regulatory rulebook should be good news for crypto investors in the long run, even if the actual rules turn out to be heavy-handed at first. Even an imperfect attempt is better than nothing.
And of course, all of this negative attention to cryptocurrencies has the counter-intuitive effect of driving more business to the Coinbase platform. The company collects transaction fees on every sale, after all, and Coinbase doesn't actually hold a lot of digital currency on its balance sheet.
The company reports fourth-quarter results next Thursday, and I think many bearish investors will be surprised to see this business thriving while crypto prices are falling. Keep an eye on this important report next week."

You can find him on Twitter @PenningsDerek.
Not Again
It happened. Again. Price dropped more than 50% from its all-time high. During times like these, people wonder whether the bottom is in or not. Nobody wants to sell the bottom. And nobody likes to buy a dip that keeps on dipping either.
There are a lot of indicators. Some of which we call “on-chain” indicators and some are technical price indicators. For example, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily time frame. When it hits 20 or lower, then it’s really something. Or what about Fibonacci levels? All great indicators to get some sense of price action. But does it make it a great entry indicator? It may be useful, but it’s always relative to the previous price action, which isn’t a fundamental threshold. It’s technical.
Realized Price
So, which indicator has a fundamental threshold? We like to watch the realized price closely. In an earlier written article, we explain how we look at the bitcoin (market) price with the realized price as an anchor. When the price of bitcoin goes below the realized price, it means that, on average, bitcoin HODLers are at a loss. Early investors may still be in profit, but most investors are at a loss.
On January 31, 2022, the realized price was around $23,900. In the history of bitcoin, it rarely happens that the market price reaches this level or even goes below it. But even when it happens, it doesn’t exactly mark the bottom. Yes, it’s a darn good place to stack some extra sats, but will the price stop from dropping at this level? On January 14, 2015, it most certainly did not. With a realized price of $310.91 and a market price of $172.21, it went a lot lower. Maybe this was because the second peak of the 2013 bull market was an outlier, and the realized price was front running the “normal tech adoption curve.” We might elaborate on that hypothesis in a different article, but for now, let’s focus on an entry spot.
Adjusted Realized Price
There were times that the bitcoin price went through a large correction and the price recovered again before touching or getting near the realized price. Since 2020, large investors are stepping in and are changing the rules of the game. Michael Saylor likes to add bitcoin to his balance sheet when the price drops and President Bukele is also smashing the buy button on his phone when price dips. So, it might take years for the bitcoin price to reach the realized price again. It may never happen again, ever. Are you willing to wait for that?
So, what if we adjust the realized price for lost coins. Coins that haven’t been moved for over seven years, may never move again. The adjusted realized price is around $30,649 (depends on how you calculate it). This might sound more realistic. We already saw a wick to $33,000. But even this adjusted realized price isn’t always a perfect entry indicator.
Framework For An Entry Indicator
But what makes an entry indicator a good entry indicator? Let’s think about it. There are a couple of factors that you want to account for. The first is the moment in time. Because the rate of bitcoin that inflates the total circulating supply halves every four years, you might consider buying if a halving is near or you might wait longer if a halving just happened 18 months ago and the next one is still 30 months away.
The second is the difference between the expected valuation of bitcoin during that certain halving period and the actual market price. If the current price is way lower than the expected price, you might consider buying, and if the price is at par or higher, you might want to wait for a lower price.
The third is the current state of the market. Are short-term holders freaking out again and panic selling? Are long-term holders keeping their faith or are diamond hands even turning into paper hands?
Stock-To-Flow Deflection
Almost everyone in the Bitcoin space heard about the stock-to-flow (S2F) model. It values bitcoin by its scarcity. The deflection is the current price divided by the valuation of the stock-to-flow model. Stock-to-flow became a very controversial model. It probably is (way) too bullish in the long run, because it doesn’t have diminishing returns built in, yet there is empirical evidence that there are diminishing returns in bitcoin.
But the model could still be very useful. What it does is value the price of bitcoin during a specific halving (expectation). And it is useful to distinguish which period you find yourself in between halvings (time). Even if the expected value of S2F will be proven to be too high, it still can be used in an entry indicator. Why? Because we are creating a ratio and if the S2F price is too high, the “green zone” of the ratio will be lower than if S2F was (entirely) correct.
Percent Of Supply In Profit
With the S2F deflection having both the expected valuation and time covered, we still have to deal with behavior and sentiment to find a great entry point. To get a feeling about what the sentiment is during a correction, it’s useful to watch how many people are under water with their bitcoin purchase. This is possible with the metric of percent of supply in profit, because if 70% of the supply is in profit, 30% isn’t.
Since the bitcoin price has only gone up on a high time frame, one could state that it would be new market participants which have the highest chance of getting in an unrealized loss position. We also know that the younger the coins, the higher the probability they will be sold. Therefore, the probability that new participants are the panic sellers, which sell at a loss, is very high compared to investors who have been in the market longer.
The influence of percent of supply in profit (PSiP) is very important for identifying a bottom and thus a great entry. When the PSiP goes down during a correction and rises again, it means paper hands sold their bitcoin. Chances are that if enough bitcoin has been sold at a loss, the bottom begins to form. The new owners aren’t at a loss and won’t sell the newly acquired bitcoin anytime soon. Typically, these new owners are also investors who have a strong conviction and have been through multiple severe corrections.
If the PSiP is still low and keeps going lower, it means that paper hands still have enough hopium and capitulation needs to kick in before a bottom will form.
The Entry Indicator
Multiplying stock-to-flow deflection (S2FD) with the PSiP gives a value ranging from 0.15 up to one. Only when the market price exceeds the S2F value, the indicator also goes higher, like the blow-off tops in 2011, 2013 and 2014. One could also notice that the bottoms of this metric are forming slightly lower lows over time, which would indicate that the bottom value would be descending over time. The descending of the bottom could be an indicator that S2F valuation is too bullish, but we’ll leave that open for debate.

When the indicator comes near 0.2, historically, it has always been a great entry point. Note that these buying moments are also shown outside of bear markets. One could see that two buying opportunities are nicely presented in the bull run of 2017, but surprisingly also in mid-2021 and in the most recent one in January 2022.
Dynamics
The dynamics between the S2FD and PSiP is extraordinary. Let’s take January 6, 2021, for example. The market price was $36,850 and the S2FD was 0.987, and thus, the S2F price was $ 37,340. The PSiP was 100%. So every (on-chain) bitcoin HODLer was at profit. The entry indicator (TEI) gives 0.987 times 100% which equals 0.987. So, the price was almost at par. Nobody was at a loss and price was at the expected level for this epoch thus it wasn’t a great entry point.
Let’s look at moments in time when there was a big correction. On August 25, 2015, the price fell to $211.04 while S2FD was 0.578 and PSiP was 36.5%. TEI gave 0.21.
Fast-forward to December 15, 2018, the price was $3,255 and S2FD was 0.463 and PSiP was 40.18%. TEI gave 0.186. Slightly more HODLers were in profit than back in 2015, but the deflection between market price and S2F price was larger.
One could get a great entry during a bear market, but even during a bull market such entries will present themselves. After reaching a new all-time high of $2,991 on June 11, 2017, we pulled back to $1,914 within weeks. With a PSiP of 78%, one could discuss if this would make a great entry. However, the S2FD was 0.35 resulting in a TEI of 0.273. In hindsight, it actually was a great entry point despite being in the midst of a bull run.
The same happened in the spring of 2021. On July 19, 2021, the bitcoin price was $30,834 and S2FD was 0.279, but PSiP was only 65.8%, which gave TEI 0.177. The outcome is almost the same as in 2018 and 2015, but it has a different structure. In 2015 and 2018, the S2F.D was less severe, but the supply at a loss was larger. In 2021, the S2FD was really large, which resulted in a low number, but the supply at a loss wasn’t that ugly.
It looks like there is a correlation between the consensus of bitcoin HODLers about the price in each halving period and the amount of (unrealized) loss they will endure during that halving. In 2015, there was consensus about price being relatively high and when price dropped a lot of supply was at a loss. In 2021, there was consensus about price being relatively low, but it also made sure that supply held wasn’t that much exposed to (unrealized) losses.
Over time, it seems that around 0.2 is a very good entry point and almost every time the actual bottom. Spoiler alert, this time, TEI was at 0.2 at $35,000! Time for an entry?

Digital asset exchange Binance has become the first crypto company to support the Association of Banks of Russia in efforts devoted to regulating the country’s growing cryptocurrency market. The coin trading platform will also work with authorities in Moscow as they try to adopt rules for the industry.
Binance to Provide Crypto Expertise to Russian Banking Sector and Government
The world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has joined the Association of Banks of Russia (ABR) to share its regulatory experience with Russian financial institutions and government as they tailor their approach to oversight in the crypto space. Announcing the move to local media, its representatives noted that Binance is the first crypto platform to work within the banking industry organization.
The ABR has recently established an Expert Center on Digital Financial Assets and Digital Currencies, tasked to study the global practice of regulating the circulation of crypto assets. The body will also serve as a platform for dialogue between experts in the field of cryptocurrencies and Russian federal authorities and legislators, RBC Crypto reported.
Olga Goncharova, director of government relations at Binance for Russia and the CIS countries, has been appointed to lead the expert center. Binance’s Director for Eastern Europe Gleb Kostarev emphasized that the exchange has a solid track record of working with regulators around the world. He was also quoted as stating:
I am sure that our developments, our expertise will be positively received by the Russian banking community.
In the past few weeks, government officials in Moscow and members of the country’s financial industry have been working hard to fill the gaps in Russia’s regulatory framework remaining after the adoption of the law “On Digital Financial Assets,” which went into force in January of last year.
While Bank of Russia has proposed a blanket ban on a range of related operations, including trading, most other institutions have backed the Finance Ministry’s view that legalization is a better alternative. After the federal government approved its concept, the treasury department is now drafting two laws for the Russian crypto economy.
A report by Kommersant revealed earlier this month that some of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges are ready to work in Russia under the proposed new rules, including a requirement to open a local office or register a Russian legal entity. Binance’s Goncharova told the business daily that the platform supports the government’s regulatory roadmap which, in her words, “will make operations more understandable, transparent, and user-friendly.”

The case of Cardano and its price potential has been examined by Finder in its latest panel poll. According to the opinion of the analysts consulted, cardano’s price will reach $58 by 2030. The panel also predicted that the smart contracts-enabled, peer-reviewed currency will finish this year with a price of $2.72.
Cardano to Jump 168% by the End of 2022
Cardano’s future is bright according to the latest analyst poll made by Finder, a comparison website and money app. In its latest Cardano-centric report, a panel of analysts predicted that the smart contracts-enabled cryptocurrency will reach a price of $58 by 2030. The poll also predicted that cardano would finish this year with a price of $2.72, jumping more than 160%.
One of the biggest proponents of Cardano on the panel, chief product officer at Permission, Vanessa Harris, believes that the currency could reach the $3 dollar mark this year. She explained her opinion, stating:
[Cardano is] one of the few smart contract platforms that have placed security, correctness [and] decentralization at their core, backed by formal methods and peer-reviewed research.
While Cardano has been criticized for the slowness of its advancement when it comes to including new features and functions into its codebase, Harris believes this will aid the currency in being adopted by nation-states and non-governmental organizations due to its resilience.
However, not all of the consulted experts were equally bullish. Among the bearish ones are Balthazar’s CEO John Stefanidis and investor Veronica Mihai. Stefanidis sees cardano’s price dropping in 2022 due to “lack of execution and poor technology.” Mihai also thinks that cardano’s price will go lower in the next ten years. She declared:
Unless they achieve great tech advances and a significant user base, it may suffer the same fate as most POS coins.
Cardano’s Journey so Far
While Cardano was launched back in 2017, the cryptocurrency just recently started integrating smart contracts into its code. The smart contracts hard fork, called Alonzo, was applied last year and hoped to bring important defi apps to the ecosystem. However, some think the currency has failed, comparatively, to amass significant TVL behind the defi platforms available.
This is one factor the panel sees as relevant when it comes to the price dip of cardano after the Alonzo hard fork. 33% of the panelists stated this was a factor when it comes to price action so far. Others also attributed this to general market volatility and also to still being early in the post-update stages.
What do you think about Cardano’s price prediction for the coming years? Tell us in the comments section below.

With spot price action passing 50% losses versus November’s all-time highs last month, expectations were for cold feet to kick in — but among seasoned hodlers, the sell-off never came.
In fact, the opposite has been true for an extended period — long-term investors are adding to their positions or staying put on their BTC exposure.
According to Glassnode’s HODL Waves indicator, as of Feb. 18, 60.61% of the BTC supply has not been used in a transaction for a year or more.

The figure is significant — only twice before in Bitcoin’s history has the one-year-or-more value reached that level.
As noted by entrepreneur and investor Alistair Milne, both occasions followed a downtrend and preceded a major bounceback in Bitcoin price action.
There have only been two occasions where 1yr+ HODL'ing of #Bitcoin has been higher (currently 61%).
Early 2016, price $380-450 range
Mid-2020, price ~$9000
Both times were during a prolonged consolidation before a huge bull move — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) February 18, 2022
As such, the odds are on for an altogether different trend to form for Bitcoin in the mid-term, this potentially defying the broadly gloomy narrative over flagging macro suppor, rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions.
“Long term HODL’ers patiently HODL’ing because they know what’s likely coming soon,” Philip Swift, analyst at trading suite Decentrader, added about the data.
Low-timeframe moves spell pain for speculators
Short-term trends thus appear of little consequence for the majority of the Bitcoin in circulation, these nonetheless causing modest anxiety this week.

Unaware of what aspects could be implemented, this has led to some traders opting to sell their Bitcoin, with the price having dropped from more than $68,000 to just above $37,000.
Why is Bitcoin going down?
Part of the reason behind this sharp decline in the value of Bitcoin is down to policy changes from the US Federal Reserve, as its chair, Jerome Powell, declared last December that the monthly rate at which it reduces asset purchases would be doubled by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
The measures brought forward by the Federal Reserve to try and control inflation have resulted in Bitcoin being negatively impacted, as the value of supposedly risky assets, such as Bitcoin, has declined somewhat after the fiscally conversative changes.
What's more, as Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted and is viewed as a more reliable option, it will become stronger but the value of it will go down. At the moment, the price goes up and down in a manner similar to stocks.
What should Bitcoin investors do?
The recent market changes should not lead Bitcoin investors to panic, although it's worth understanding the reason behind the price movements.
Aside from the rumors and government policy changes, the price of Bitcoin and other digital assets will begin to be more in correlation with the prices we see with traditional assets.
Any Bitcoin investors who are worried about the cryptocurrency's price are able to benefit from monitoring developments related to both Bitcoin and the broader financial market.
""This is the fifth time Bitcoin's price has fallen by 50% or more since its inception in 2009,"" said Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.
Yet, it is expected that there will be more regulation of Bitcoin and other digital assets."

Trader on BTC: “Nothing to get excited about”
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD losing ground Sunday, following threats of fresh sanctions on Russia over its alleged plans to invade neighboring Ukraine.
After a quiet Saturday, crypto began to move downhill after comments from United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson on financial blocks of Russian firms should the situation escalate.
These would be prohibited from “trading in pounds and dollars,” the BBC reported Johnson as saying Sunday morning, alluding to support from United States President Joe Biden.
With crypto as the only markets constantly open, the reaction to geopolitical fears in the region could foreshadow a greater knock-on effect next week as traditional markets open. Monday is a holiday on Wall Street.
Commenting on the situation, Mike McGlone, chief commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, additionally drew attention to the ongoing issue of inflation and its relationship to risk asset performance.
In line with previous comments, however, he suggested that ultimately, Bitcoin could profit from the sea of change in U.S. economic policy this year.
“Bitcoin indicating a rough week ahead — Inflation Unlikely to Drop Unless Risk Assets Do: Most assets are subject to the ebbing tide in 2022, on the inevitable reversion of the greatest inflation measures in four decades, but this year may mark another milestone for Bitcoin,” he argued.
Among Bitcoin traders, short timeframes were now equally lackluster, with the loss of $40,000 weighing on sentiment.
Now also failing to hold any support. I can see us retesting 40K within the next few days as we're at support on LTF but generally the HTF isn't something to get excited about until we retake some important levels. — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) February 20, 2022
BTC/USD saw lows of $37,974 on Bitstamp Sunday before rebounding to hold above the $38,000 mark.
Extreme fear rises from the dead
Others, meanwhile, continued to focus on the significance of $40,000 in Bitcoin’s price history.

Since first cracking it in 2021, the level has acted as a springboard for bulls, and for popular Twitter account Mayne, a recapture should indeed be their first move in order to secure upside.
“Over the last year $40k has been a very critical level for BTC. Each time price broke below and then reclaimed it we’ve seen a large rally to the upside. Probably a good area to watch right now,” it commented Sunday.
In the meantime, however, it appeared that fresh losses were what the masses expected. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index was back in “fear” territory on the day, having seen a drop of over 50% in just four days, after briefly entering “extreme fear.”"

Du Jun told CNBC that bitcoin bull markets are closely tied to a process called halving, which occurs every few years.
This relates to so-called miners on the bitcoin network, which run powerful specialized computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions on the bitcoin network. Miners are rewarded in bitcoin as a result.
Halving is written into bitcoin's underlying code and cuts in half the reward that so-called miners get for validating transactions on the cryptocurrency's network. It occurs roughly every four years.
The last halving took place in May 2020, and in 2021, bitcoin topped an all-time high above $68,000. A similar occurrence happened when halving took place in 2016. The following year, bitcoin hit what was at the time a record high."

The value of stablecoins in circulation rose to $157 billion USD by the end of 2021, compared with $5.6 billion at the beginning of 2020.
The Biden administration, the Federal Reserve System and the Financial Stability Board recently raised concerns about ""stablecoins"", suggesting that these unique cryptocurrencies could pose a major risk to global financial stability.

After Bitcoin and Libra – Facebook’s dead-on-arrival digital currency – global financial regulation authorities have a new enemy: stablecoins. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) specifically targeted these cryptocurrencies in its report on the dangers of crypto assets, published on February 16.
Growth of stablecoins has continued through 2021 “despite concerns about regulatory compliance, quality and sufficiency of reserve assets, and standards of risk management and governance"", the global organisation, created by the G20 in 2009, wrote. Now, it said, they are poised to endanger global financial stability.
Stability in a volatile world?
Stablecoins’ status as the villain of the finance world could seem surprising for an electronic currency originally created in order to “put the brakes on the volatility of Bitcoin and to rightly bring a bit of stability into this sphere"", Nathalie Janson, economist and specialist in cryptocurrencies at Neoma Business School, told FRANCE 24.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies for which the price practically never varies, as they are indexed using a base reference such as the US dollar. For example, a Tether – the most famous and widely-used of all stablecoins – always has equal value to one US dollar.
This promise of stability has made stablecoins, and tethers especially, “the bridge between paper currencies (such as the dollar, euro, yuan, etc.) and cryptocurrencies"", financial analyst and cryptocurrency expert with consulting firm IG, Vincent Boy, told FRANCE 24.
Essentially, investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum (another cryptocurrency) avoid yo-yoing prices by exchanging their currencies into Tethers, USD coins or binance USD – all types of stablecoin – in order to know the exact dollar-value of their portfolio. Some platforms even ask users to transfer their cryptomoney into stablecoins first before changing them into dollars or other traditional currencies.
To guarantee their value, creators of ""stable"" cryptocurrencies must always keep the same amount of dollars in reserve as the number of stablecoins in circulation. For example, in December 2021, the founders of Tether said they had $78.2 million USD in the bank to cover the 78 million coins in circulation.
‘Systemic risk’ on the horizon?
This means that “today's tethers have a market value similar to that of a bank"", said Boy. This is the result of a lightning-fast rise in value: in December 2021 the market value of all stablecoins was around €157 billion USD, “an increase from $5.6 billion at the start of 2020"", according to the FBS.
Value increases for Tethers especially have caused financial authorities around the world to break out in a cold sweat. In the US, the Federal Reserve discussed the threat of stablecoins in a meeting on August 2021. “The questions being asked are how to be sure that [the creators] really have the necessary reserves and whether Tether is about to fail,” said Boy.
The growing stature of stablecoins is one of the main signs of the “democratisation of investments in cryptocurrency"", said Boy. The more people who want to exchange dollars for Bitcoins, Monero and others, the more the volume of transactions increases and the more stablecoins there are in circulation.
It follows that it is no longer just insiders that own Tethers and other stablecoins, “but also traditional investment funds, businesses and even banks"", said Janson. This is what the FSB described as stablecoins’ “increasing interconnectedness with the traditional financial system”.
If these stablecoins were to fail, it would initially mean financial losses for investors in the stock market, which could lead to wider impacts on traditional financial markets, as feared by the FSB and the US Federal Reserve.
For now, the risk is relative. “The financial influence stablecoins have is significant, but the central banks have the capacity to cover losses if there is a problem without hurting their balance sheets too much,” said Boy.
However, if Tether and other stablecoins continue to grow at the same pace as in recent years, they could “reach a systemic size, meaning they have become ‘too big to fail’"", he added.
Transparency and crystal balls
As long as stablecoin creators have sufficient reserves, there is no risk of failure. But this is another aspect causing concern for financial authorities: “Stablecoin issuers are not subject to a consistent set of standards regarding the composition of reserve assets … and there is a lack of consistency in disclosure practices,” warned the FSB.
Currently the FSB must take promises from these stablecoin creators at face value as audits on their reserves – when they are done – are not necessarily carried out by leading organisations or according to international standards. Just three years ago, Tether was widely suspected of being nothing but a big scam – hardly reassuring for a cryptocurrency that is now central to a whole financial ecosystem.
However, stablecoins have made some efforts towards transparency. “What we do know now is that they don’t just have reserves in dollars but also in short-term investments that allows them to make payments,” said Janson.
But this is still a problem. “The authorities are obsessed by the idea of a new liquidity crisis, like the one that happened in 2008,” she added. In the era of subprime mortgages, when the market came to understand that the financial products offered by Lehman Brothers and others partially relied on valueless assets, no one wated to touch them anymore, plunging the banks into deep financial crisis.
What would happen if the same scenario were to happen with stablecoins that are not 100% transparent about their reserves? “For example, some stablecoins may be tied to debt from Evergrand [the Chinese real-estate giant verging on failure], as has been suggested for Tether. In this case the reserves could come to be worth much less, which could make it impossible to reimburse everyone if they needed to,” said Boy.
Hence the calls from the FSB and the Federal Reserve to regulate stablecoins and place them under similar obligations to banks. US President Joe Biden has also called for tighter controls.
But for Janson, such measures would go too far. She suspects the authorities are keen to put up roadblocks to prevent stablecoins competing with national cryptocurrencies currently under development in many countries. She said: “Why would we want to treat them like banks? It would be enough to impose stricter transparency obligations, as that is the main problem.”

Huobi’s Executive on the Next Bitcoin Bull Market
Du Jun, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, discussed when the next bitcoin bull market might be in an interview with CNBC, published Sunday.
The exchange executive explained that bitcoin bull markets are closely tied to the halving, which occurs every 210,000 blocks or approximately every 4 years. The next one will take place in 2024.
He detailed that the last halving took place in May 2020, and bitcoin topped an all-time high above $68,000 in 2021. Similarly, the halving that took place in 2016 saw BTC hitting a record high the following year. The price of bitcoin then tumbled after hitting record highs.
Noting that bitcoin has fallen about 40% since its all-time high in November last year, Du was quoted by the news outlet as saying if the pattern continues:
We are now at the early stage of a bear market … Following this cycle, it won’t be until end of 2024 to beginning of 2025 that we can welcome next bull market on bitcoin.
Nonetheless, he admitted: “It is really hard to predict exactly because there are so many other factors which can affect the market as well — such as geopolitical issues including war, or recent Covid, also affect the market.”
A number of people believe that we are in a crypto winter, including the analysts at Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, who recently warned of a crypto winter amid expectations of Fed rate hikes and regulation. Last week, veteran trader Peter Brandt also pointed out that bitcoin’s price corrections “can be lengthy.”

Contrary to the expectations of many in the crypto market, Bitcoin (BTC) failed to surge above $68,000 in 2021 and continued dropping below $40,000 in early 2022, causing significant losses for big crypto investors such as MicroStrategy.
However, a possible crypto winter could be pretty helpful for the industry by giving a boost in improving the technology, according to Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain. Lower cryptocurrency prices could contribute to nurturing long-term sustainable projects while removing short-term speculative attention, Buterin said in a Bloomberg interview on Saturday:
“The winters are the time when a lot of those applications fall away and you can see which projects are actually long-term sustainable, like both in their models and in their teams and their people.”
The 28-year-old cryptocurrency billionaire pointed out that people who are “deep into crypto, and especially building things,” actually welcome a bear market. “They welcome the bear market because when there are these long periods of prices moving up by huge amounts as it does — it does obviously make a lot of people happy — but it does also tend to invite a lot of very short-term speculative attention,” Buterin added.
If true, cryptocurrency projects will definitely have enough time to improve technology until the next rally as some crypto experts believe that the next bull market will not arrive until late 2024.
Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi crypto exchange, believes that the next Bitcoin bull run will not happen until 2024 and is likely to occur after Bitcoin’s fourth halving, which is expected to take place in July 2024.
All three previous BTC halvings, including the previous one that happened in 2020, triggered subsequent growth of the Bitcoin price due to a programmatic slow down in the new BTC supply. Occurring only once every four years, the upcoming Bitcoin halving will reduce the Bitcoin block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
Pointing to a massive crypto winter of 2018, which followed the second Bitcoin halving and a subsequent rally in 2017, Du stressed that the crypto market has been moving in cycles tied to halvings, stating:
“If this circle continues, we are now at the early stage of a bear market. Following this cycle, it won’t be until the end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025 that we can welcome the next bull market on Bitcoin.”

Du added that it’s very difficult to predict the crypto market cycles exactly because there are many other factors, including geopolitical issues such as war, COVID-19 and others.

The processing power behind the Bitcoin network has dropped 30% since the hashrate’s all-time high (ATH) on February 15, sliding from 249 exahash per second (EH/s) to 169 EH/s. Furthermore, four days from now, the network’s mining difficulty is expected to increase following the 4.78% epoch change on February 17.
Bitcoin Hashrate Drops From 249 Exahash per Second to 169 EH/S in 12 Days
From January 13 to February 15, Bitcoin’s hashrate was coasting along at record highs for roughly 33 consecutive days. This weekend, on Sunday, February 27, 2022, the hashrate has dropped 30% from the 249 EH/s ATH captured on February 15. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s (BTC) network hashrate is around 168.14 EH/s or 168,144,793,932,750,200,000 hashes per second (H/s).
Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price has been lower than usual but 30-day statistics show the price per BTC is up 4.4%. Although, bitcoin mining monthly revenue and 7DMA revenue mining stats are down according to onchain metrics. The drop in processing power speed may help drop the next difficulty change, as it’s expected to increase by 1.18% in four days to 27.64 trillion. If the difficulty does increase in four days, it will be the seventh consecutive difficulty increase since November 28, 2021.
Currently, the top bitcoin mining pool during the last three days is Foundry USA with 20.52% of the global hashrate (38.85 EH/s) and finding 79 block rewards within that time frame. Foundry USA is followed by Antpool’s 30.49 EH/s or 16.10% of the global hashrate. At the time of writing, three-day metrics indicate that there’s 11 known bitcoin mining pools today. Unknown hashrate or stealth miners command 1.3% of the global hashrate or 2.46 EH/s of hashpower capturing five block rewards in three days.
Presently, the most-profitable SHA256-based application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining device is the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro 110 terahash per second (TH/s) machine. Using today’s BTC exchange rate and $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), the Antminer S19 Pro makes just over $10 per day. The Microbt Whatsminer M30S++ (112 TH/s) makes $9.82 per day in bitcoin profits.

A recent report states that freelancing is experiencing a boom in Argentina, and also comments on how Argentinians are among workers in the region that most actively use cryptocurrencies to receive part of their paycheck. The report further states that workers accepting their paychecks in crypto favor traditional cryptocurrencies such as ether and bitcoin, which together amount to almost 90% of the payments made in crypto.
Freelancing and Crypto Becoming More Popular in Argentina
Freelancing seems to be experiencing a boom in Argentina, and with it, crypto, as a way of collecting payments outside of the traditional financial system. A report titled “State of Global Hiring 2021,” made by Deel, a global hiring firm, has discovered that Argentinians, and Latam in general, are increasingly focusing on international companies and jobs. The report explains this is likely a result of the decline of local economies and jobs due to the after-effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, companies are hiring more Argentinians than ever before. This has created an increase in the wages of Argentinians in the last six months, who are earning 21% more working in the marketing, products, and sales sector.
Cryptocurrency withdrawals of these salaries have also boomed. Regarding this trend, Deel COO Dan Westgarth stated:
We are seeing an increase in cryptocurrency withdrawals, in countries like Argentina. We currently offer withdrawals in BTC -the most popular in Latin America-, ETH, USDC and SOL through Coinbase.
The most used cryptocurrency for global withdrawals is bitcoin, with 63% of transactions using it, according to the Deel report. Ethereum comes in a distant second place, being present in 23% of the withdrawals made. USDC, Solana, and Dash are also used marginally.
Crypto as an Alternative
While other countries have different legal situations, in Argentina, receiving cryptocurrencies has become a lifeline for many freelancers, helping them keep their purchasing power in a more effective way. These freelancing platforms, along with crypto, are also said to open new markets for such workers, who can now be hired at a worldwide level with a simplified payments process.
Argentina is currently seeking to regulate and control digital wallets, as its central bank is proposing to strengthen the measures providers like Mercado Pago and Uala will have to take regarding KYC-AML.

Ukraine's government has raised more than $10 million in cryptocurrency donations, turning to an unlikely crowdfunding method to help it get through a brutal invasion from Russia.
The official Twitter account of the Ukrainian government on Saturday posted addresses for two crypto wallets, one accepting only bitcoin and the other taking ether and tether, a token that tracks the value of the U.S. dollar.
As of Sunday, those wallets have attracted $10.2 million worth of crypto, according to research from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. That's on top of the millions in digital currency donated to nongovernmental organizations supporting the Ukrainian military.
About $1.86 million of the money donated to Ukraine's government was generated through the sale of a non-fungible token, or NFT, originally intended to raise funds for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Elliptic said.
NFTs are unique digital assets designed to represent ownership of virtual items, such as artwork or video game characters."

Tensions mount for TradFi markets open
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD making several attempts to break out of the $30,000–$40,000 corridor on Feb. 27, all of which ended in rejection.
The pair had stayed broadly higher throughout the weekend, cutting traders some slack after a week of volatility at the hands of geopolitics and media headlines.
Now, $38,500 was the level to watch for Bitcoin to close out the week and the month — failure to do so would mean a fourth straight monthly red candle.

As Cointelegraph reported, bulls were spared a lower low last week, despite the downside move on the Ukraine invasion, bottoming out at $34,300 versus $32,800 in January.
""Cautiously optimistic this is a short to mid-term bottom for BTC,"" popular trader and analyst Pentoshi continued.
""I pulled my 40.3K orders (not great) and will focus higher to 41.6K for de-risking. Must flip that and there's some pretty decent upside. I am still cautious bc the macro landscape, imo is anything but bullish.""
That macro landscape was poised to deliver a fresh bout of uncertainty on Feb. 28's open, thanks to moves by the West to cut Russian banks off from off-shore liquidity and the SWIFT payment system.
A mention of Russia's nuclear deterrent by President Vladimir Putin likewise ruffled feathers over the weekend, with Ukraine and Russia beginning negotiations on the Belarusian border on Feb. 27.
For Bitcoin proponents, meanwhile, the potential knock-on impact of Russian financial sanctions and the cryptocurrency's status as a neutral network for value transfer began to take center stage.

""Still processing the implications,"" former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan wrote as part of a Twitter response about freezing the central bank assets.
""This is a financial neutron bomb. Bankrupts people without blowing up buildings. Hits all 145M Russians at once, every ruble holder. In a maximalist scenario, possible collapse of the Russian economy.""
On its part, Ukraine began to accept donations for its army in Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and Tether (USDT). Its wallets had received over 91 BTC ($3.57 million), as well as 1,797 ETH ($5.02 million) and $1 million in USDT at the time of writing.
Weekend stays ""boring"" for crypto
For crypto markets overall, however, there were few opportunities as sentiment remained very much in ""wait and see"" mode.

144,2022-02-27,2022-02-27,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,www.inc.com,4 Reasons Your E-Commerce Business Should Accept Cryptocurrency,Cryptocurrency has made its way into the mainstream. Here are four reasons to consider adding it as a payment option for your e-commerce customers.,https://www.inc.com/maria-haggerty/4-reasons-your-e-commerce-business-should-accept-cryptocurrency.html,"While cryptocurrency was named for its use of encryption to verify transactions, its cryptic role and function in commerce today makes the name even more apropos. And while it will be a while before the average consumer has working understanding of this digital currency, what is clear--especially to anyone who tuned into the Super Bowl commercials this year--is that cryptocurrency has made its way into the mainstream.
If you want to keep your e-commerce business on the cutting edge, it's time to think about adding cryptocurrency to the list of accepted payment options for your online store. Here's why.
Consumer adoption is on the rise.
While there is still considerable confusion and mystery surrounding what cryptocurrency is and how it works, digital currency is more popular than you might imagine. In fact, nearly half (48 percent) of U.S. consumers reported investing money in cryptocurrency during the first half 2021, according to a Consumer Crypto Survey of more than 2,000 U.S. consumers.
In terms of global consumers, a 2021 Visa study found that 21 percent are active owners--meaning they have used cryptocurrency to send or receive money, to buy goods, or to accept payment at least once. A smaller group (11 percent) reported having purchased cryptocurrency as an investment, but have not made any transactions.
So, while most consumers aren't actively participating in the marketplace yet, there is considerable awareness and curiosity, and the shift from passive to active could happen at the drop of a dime.
You don't want to be late to the party.
Leading e-commerce stores, platforms, and payment systems are already on board. Among highly trafficked e-commerce platforms and stores that currently accept various cryptocurrencies are Shopify, Overstock.com, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, and eGifter. Last year, PayPal introduced Checkout with Crypto, giving its users the option to use digital currency to make purchases with merchants that accept PayPal--as of the fourth quarter of 2021, that's 426 million active users. And Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, also now allows more than 76 million to access cryptocurrency from within the app.
While the majority of consumers aren't currently engaging with cryptocurrency, more are earning it in the form of rewards. My company's clientele consists largely of beauty brands, which happens to also be a very popular category on Lolli, a rewards application that allows users to earn Bitcoin when shopping online. With over 1,000 merchants partnered with the platform, there are now hundreds of thousands of active shoppers earning crypto that is sitting in their digital wallets, ready to be spent.
It's fast.
When it comes to e-commerce, faster is generally better, and processing payments is no exception. This falls in cryptocurrency's favor, as transactions are processed immediately, whereas credit card systems take a few days. As a business owner looking at things from a cash flow perspective, having that quicker access to funds is quite an attractive feature.
It opens up your market.
Because it's still relatively early to be accepting cryptocurrency in e-commerce stores, doing so may attract new demographic groups who are eager to be on the cutting edge. And from the looks of some of the research that's been reported, these groups are here to spend.
A 2020 Forrester study found that accepting Crypto attracts new customers and boosts average order value, with purchase amounts twice that of credit card purchases. And in 2021, the Cryptocurrency Payments Report found that 31 percent of cryptocurrency owners make purchases in the $100 to $1,000 range, while 19 percent make purchases that are valued at more than $1,000.
Adding a payment option--especially one so novel--is not a decision to be taken lightly. Cryptocurrencies face all kinds of criticisms, including their use in illegal activities, volatility in exchange rates, and the vulnerability of their basic infrastructure. And because they are virtual, there is no central database to store them, which means they can be lost if the hard drive they're stored on is lost or destroyed. What makes cryptocurrency attractive as a form of e-commerce payment is its ability to easily transfer funds from one place to another without the need for a third-party financial institution."

The most popular crypto asset has gained back around 23 per cent of its value after slumping to around $34,900 on 24th February 2022.
According to experts, Bitcoin has gained traction as a last resort of transaction amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine (read details here).
The value of Bitcoin has even become bigger than the value of Ruble, the Russian fiat currency (check full report here).
Amid a positive price trend in the crypto market at a time when there is a general downfall in stock markets during the ongoing geopolitical crisis, Bitcoin enthusiasts are hoping that the popular crypto asset may soon rise to its all time high value (see bitcoin price prediction for 2022). By the end of this month, they are expecting Bitcoin to touch the $50,000 price barrier. Will it happen?
Experts say that Bitcoin price is set to increase to new highs due to several factors playing in its favour this month.
“Bitcoin has decoupled itself from equities markets. While Bitcoin prices rose, S&P index nosedived amidst concerns of rising oil prices and commodities. Bitcoin is likely to regain its safe haven status as the Ukraine-Russia crisis is expected to play out longer than expected. There has been a significant rise in the number of wallet addresses holding 1000BTC . Fed is on shaky ground. Given the recession fears, the number of Fed rate hikes is expected to be lower in 2022. All these factors will cumulatively propel Bitcoin prices to newer highs in March,” Sharat Chandra, VP- Research and Strategy , EarthID, a self-sovereign Identity Management Platform, told FE Online.
Turning point for crypto
Experts also say that the Russia-Ukraine war has proved to be one of the turning points for the crypto industry.
“The Russia-Ukraine War is one of the turning point event for Crypto Industry. From Accepting Crypto in the form of donations and for international trade medium besides SWIFT, we are seeing growth in DAO like UkraineDAO to handle War crisis support by Crypto. If national trade can be done via Crypto, it is definitely going to impact pricing,” Dileep Seinberg, Founder and CEO at Thinkchain, said.
He further said that Bitcoin is the only Decentralised Currency which can become legal tender for several nations unlike other altcoins, which mostly work under centralised agency owned by people or organisations.
However, Seinberg doesn’t think Bitcoin will hit $50,000 within a month.
“Although, hitting a $50,000 mark again within a month wont be happening. this might take another 21-25 days of consistent performance to reach $50,000,” he said.
Meanwhile, prices of other crypto assets like Ether, Solana, Binance Coin also seem to be recovering.

The bullish price action signals a potential trend reversal.
Breaking $48,250 could send BTC towards $56,000.

Bitcoin is back in the spotlight after gaining more than 20% in market value over the last three days. Further upward pressure may have the strength to kick start a new uptrend.
Bitcoin Regains Lost Ground
Bitcoin continues trending upwards, signaling the possible beginning of a new uptrend.
The flagship cryptocurrency is on the rise as the buying pressure behind it increases. Prices surged to an intraday high of $45,350 at press time, following three days of upward momentum. While global markets remain on shaky grounds, it appears that Bitcoin could be heading to greener pastures.
The parabolic SAR suggests the downtrend BTC has been trapped in since early November 2021 may have reached exhaustion. The stop and reversal points moved below the price of Bitcoin on the weekly chart, which is considered to be a positive sign. The recent flip indicates that the direction of the trend changed from bearish to bullish.
Historically, parabolic SAR has been highly effective in determining the course of Bitcoin’s price. The last four times the stop and reversal system flipped from bearish to bullish on the weekly chart, BTC’s price surged by 73%, 644%, 43%, and 250%, respectively.
Even though the odds appear to favor the bulls, IntoTheBlock’s IOMAP reveals that the top cryptocurrency may still face stiff resistance ahead.
Nearly 3.40 million addresses had previously purchased more than 1.71 million BTC between $47,000 and $49,500. Given the significance of this supply wall, traders may need to wait for a decisive weekly close above it to confirm the optimistic outlook. Breaking through the $48,250 barrier could then propel Bitcoin towards $56,000.
It is worth noting that Bitcoin must remain trading above $38,300 for the bullish thesis to prevail. Failing to hold above this support level could trigger a sell-off that sends prices back towards $30,000.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked a slew of economic sanctions from governments around the world, sending the Russian currency plunging to record lows and raising the spectre of hyperinflation.
Meanwhile, crypto trading has risen, with Ukraine calling for donations in digital currencies to back its war effort, and raising $35 million (€31.5 million) so far, according to the blockchain analysis firm Elliptic.
'Meme coins' worth more than roubles
The market capitalisation of Bitcoin worldwide now exceeds that of the rouble, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
That means that all of the Bitcoin traded worldwide is worth, together, more than all of the roubles in circulation worldwide.
The Russian currency is currently ranked 17th in market value, behind the Thai baht and the Mexican peso.
The rouble is now worth even less than Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that was initially created as a joke poking fun at the wild speculation surrounding cryptocurrencies.
On Wednesday, Ukraine's vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced his country was now also accepting donations in Dogecoin, also dubbed the ""meme coin"".
In February, Ukraine's parliament passed a law legalising the use of cryptocurrency, and the country ranks fourth in the world in terms of cryptocurrency adoption, according to the blockchain data platform Chainalysis.
Rouble buckling under sanctions
Western allies have sought to punish Russia for its attack with harsh financial sanctions, excluding some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system and freezing Russia’s central bank reserves.
The sanctions have caused the rouble to plunge to record lows against the dollar, and sent Russian people queuing outside banks to withdraw cash.
As the value of the rouble tumbles and the risk of hyperinflation grows, the Russian central bank moved to raise its key interest rate to 20 per cent on Monday.
EU probing use of crypto to bypass sanctions
As more Russians may now be tempted to convert their money into cryptocurrencies, Ukrainian officials have called on crypto exchanges to block Russian users and freeze assets linked to them. Many exchanges have rebuffed the calls, others have declined to comment.
Cryptocurrencies are by design a way to circumvent traditional financial institutions, and their growing success has been making Western governments nervous.
Russia is already the world's third-largest Bitcoin miner. And Iran has used Bitcoin mining in the past to bypass trade embargoes.
European Union officials admit that crypto mining and trading could be used to undermine sanctions on Russia, and say they are looking into it.
""We are aware there are routes for circumvention and various attempts to circumvent the sanctions. We are looking into this,"" an EU official told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday."

In an update to Telegram subscribers on March 2, Filbfilb, an analyst at trading suite Decentrader, joined increasingly bullish sentiment around the outlook for BTC/USD.
Trader focuses on levels above $40,000
After surprising the market with a breakout Monday, Bitcoin has risen to challenge February highs. While so far not beating them, investors and traders have reacted extremely positively to the news, and sentiment gauges show a swift transformation taking place on the market.
For Filbfilb, the prognosis is just as rosy after BTC/USD passed both the 50-day moving average (MA) and a “massive” weekly level, both of which could now function as support.
“Bitcoin looking pretty good mid week. HTFs have some key levels which are being challenged,” he summarized.
In a bleaker scenario, the point of interest for bulls to hold is $40,770, this ideally forming the minimum close into the weekend on 3-day timeframes.
“Bit of a crazy environment, literally on the brink of anything being possible, given the conflict,” Filbfilb added about the current macro situation.

Even considering the turmoil currently enslaving global markets, however, signs that the worst is over for crypto as an asset class are flowing in.
As noted by Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at United States asset management giant Fidelity Investments, both Bitcoin and related stocks appear to have put in a “double bottom” formation.
As such, for BTC/USD to continue, the existing February highs of just under $46,000 should be convincingly flipped to support.

As reported by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode this week, however, zooming out, data suggests that almost every buyer at November’s $69,000 all-time highs has now capitulated, lessening the overall desire to exit at price points between there and the current spot.
“During this 2.5 month long period of consolidation, a great deal of supply was transferred by top buyers into exchanges for sale. This supply was then gradually soaked up by higher conviction buyers, with the cost basis of these coins becoming more heavily weighted between in the $29k to $40k price range,” it explained in its latest weekly newsletter, “The Week On-Chain.”
“This behaviour describes a broad scale weak hand to strong hand redistribution event.”"

Alexander Ermochenko | Reuters
As Moscow's war on Ukraine rages on and the Russian economy and currency spiral to new lows, Washington is reportedly trying out a new way to dial up the pressure on Putin: sanctions targeting cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum. The Department of Justice announced early Wednesday a new task force broadly designed to enforce sanctions. As part of that, it will target efforts to use cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions, launder proceeds of foreign corruption or evade U.S. responses to Russian military aggression. Taking aim at Russia's access to digital cash comes as the U.S. and its allies, including notoriously neutral Switzerland, levy heavy punitive measures against Moscow. The concern is that the Kremlin, as well as other ancillary actors supporting the offensive on Ukraine, will evade the sanctions regime via digital tokens, which are not owned or issued by a central authority like a bank. Bitcoin, like most cryptocurrencies, is decentralized and borderless, which means that it doesn't respect national boundaries. Because there is no central authority to block transactions, digital currencies are also resistant. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, stats from crypto data provider Kaiko show that transactions on centralized bitcoin exchanges in both the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia have surged to their highest levels in months. This is likely part of the reason why Ukraine asked all the top crypto exchanges to ban Russian users — a request that has been rejected by many major players, who argue a move like that would go against the very reason why cryptocurrencies exist. Despite growing signs of crypto adoption — as well as dialed-up rhetoric from world leaders about banning sanctioned Russians from digital currency exchanges — crypto as a pathway to sidestepping sanctions isn't really a viable option at scale. First of all, crypto markets offer thin liquidity and token transactions are, by design, traceable via a public ledger known as the blockchain. Aside from that, experts tell CNBC that ultimately there are better and smarter ways than using bitcoin to get around global financial blockades. ""The size and scale of crypto markets — and their state of liquidity — is not sufficient enough to offset what happens from banking disruptions and other disruptions from sanctions,"" said Yaya Fanusie, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who assesses national security and money laundering risks related to digital assets. ""It's akin to, if someone were to block your paycheck for a month and then you had to rely on your piggy bank to make up for it,"" he said.
Russia is no stranger to sanctions
Russia is no stranger to sanctions, and its political class has spent years getting creative on workarounds. Moscow faced international condemnation in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine. That was also the year that a passenger plane headed from the Netherlands to Malaysia was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile fired over territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Since then, President Vladimir Putin has built buffers to insulate Russia from the blowback of Western sanctions, which economists estimate has cost Russia $50 billion a year. Typically, the way sanctions work is that a government generates a list of the individuals and companies that must be avoided, and those doing business with these banned entities are subject to heavy fines. But sanctions are only as good as the KYC (Know Your Customer) onboarding requirements, explained Sarah Beth Felix, an authority on anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance. ""Depending on how strict that is, then that drives the data, which drives whether or not the sanctions are actually effective,"" Felix says. ""That is agnostic when it comes to the underlying flow of funds, whether it be crypto, fiat, wires, payable-through accounts — it all lives or dies on the underlying data that's captured and verified on the ownership of the company, the individual, and all that kind of stuff."" Part of Putin's strategy involved diversifying away from U.S. treasuries and the U.S. dollar, cultivating a new kind of debt structure largely based on euros and gold. Putin's war chest includes $630 billion in foreign reserves, which serves as a sort of financial shield meant to dull the impact of sweeping sanctions.
The country's underlying financial fundamentals have also helped to absorb the shock. CNBC has reported that Russia has a debt-to-GDP ratio of only 18%, a current account surplus, and the price of oil surging past $113 a barrel (its highest level in more than a decade) is certainly a boon. Thus far, the White House has steered clear of sanctioning Russian oil sales. Moreover, experts tell CNBC that Russians have been bracing for this kind of crackdown for months. ""Russia's elite and financial authorities have been preparing for sanctions for some time,"" said Salman Banaei, head of public policy for North American for Chainalysis, which specializes in tracking activity on blockchain networks. Any movement of funds likely happened prior to Russia's invasion, Felix agreed.
""I would assume billions and billions of dollars already moved through these front companies and shell corporations that we have around the world that are owned by Russian businesses and individuals, regardless of whether it involved crypto or normal bank-to-bank wires,"" said Felix. Banaei agrees that it is unlikely that designated persons would opt to move around large quantities of crypto at this point. Instead, Banaei says that if cryptocurrency is being used to evade sanctions, it likely would have happened slowly, over the past several months. ""At the end of all of this, the glaring, massive gap that we have is in the transparency of who owns what companies, not just in the U.S., but around the world,"" explained Felix.
Bitcoin wouldn't work anyway
Even if Russia wanted to use crypto to evade sanctions, its economy is too big, the crypto market is too small, and any huge transactions would likely be flagged. ""The size of crypto markets is small compared to what's happening in the banking sector,"" said Fanusie. The U.S. has placed new debt and equity restrictions on some of Russia's most critical state-owned enterprises with estimated assets of nearly $1.4 trillion. These entities won't be able to raise money through the U.S. market, a critical source of capital. The total cryptocurrency market cap is at around $1.9 trillion. Cryptocurrencies are also thinly traded, which means that it can prove difficult to buy large swaths of digital tokens like bitcoin. The bitcoin-ruble pair maxes out at about $250,000 per trade on Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, versus the bitcoin and U.S. dollar pairing, which has a maximum market order of around $2.6 million. The size of the transactions that the Russian government would need to conduct would be multiples of what individual Russian citizens might be doing right now, explained anti-money laundering compliance expert Ross Delston. Not only would that prove difficult to do in terms of liquidity limitations, but it could also red flag the transaction entirely. ""On the blockchain, the size of the transaction is immediately available, and very sizable transactions would be very apparent to anyone looking,"" Delston said, who added that cryptocurrencies aren't the bastion of anonymity they are so often made out to be. While crypto has the advantage of not involving wire transfers from bank to bank (which are heavily policed to ensure sanctions compliance), every transfer ever made is captured on a public, permanent, and immutable blockchain ledger and can be traced in nanoseconds. ""If I hand you find a $5 bill, you can never trace that back to me, where if I were to transfer you money through my wallet, that's always linked back to my wallet ID, which if I went through a regulated exchange, has all of my CIP (Customer Identification Program) information,"" explained Felix. Chainalysis' Banaei tells CNBC that a single tip in the cryptocurrency market can, within hours, uncover a network of wallet addresses involved in ransomware fraud and money laundering, while a similar tip relating to a traditional bank wire could take several months to reach a similar level of visibility into a criminal network and its money laundering. While there are privacy tokens like monero, dash, and zcash, which have additional anonymity built into them, they tend not to be as liquid as other tokens, since many regulated exchanges have chosen not to list them due to regulatory concerns. There is also the question of what to do once you have the crypto in hand. ""It's hard to buy stuff with cryptocurrency, especially big stuff,"" Delston tells CNBC. He says that he doesn't know of any major electronics companies, food exporters, or spare parts manufacturers that accept cryptocurrency as payment, which he notes are ""all the kinds of things that a country like Russia would need, because it doesn't produce it on its own."" And while historically crypto exchange compliance with the global sanctions regime hasn't been great, Fanusie says it's actually getting much better, as these platforms beef up their internal compliance teams. Federal prosecutors are adding muscle to their crypto policing duties, as well. In February, the U.S. Justice Department unveiled a new cryptocurrency enforcement team.

Want to learn more about digital currencies? You're not alone.
Most adults have a beginner's understanding of cryptocurrency, but plan on using such assets as a key source of retirement funds, according to the 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey.
How to Choose the Best Cryptocurrency Wallet
Choosing the best cryptocurrency wallet depends largely on your personal needs. Here are some helpful tips to choose the wallet that's right for you.
How frequently do you plan to use your wallet?
How frequently you plan to use your crypto wallet plays an important role in choosing one that’s right for you. For example, if you plan to use cryptocurrency to make regular payments, you probably want to hold some of your funds in a mobile wallet. But if you are looking to invest in and store crypto assets over the long-term – and if you're looking to store a large amount of digital currency – you're better off securing your digital assets offline in cold storage using either a hardware or paper wallet.
If you plan to actively trade digital assets, you will probably benefit from a multi-platform wallet that allows you to manage your cryptocurrency portfolio on your desktop and on your smartphone.
Are you interested in the number of cryptocurrencies the wallet supports?
If you are looking to construct a diversified portfolio composed of a large number of digital currencies and tokens, choosing a multi-asset wallet that supports thousands of assets is probably the right decision.
Do you care about the level of customer support?
If you are a beginner, you probably want to go for a beginner-friendly wallet with an easy-to-use interface.
Not all wallet providers have customer support. Numerous long-standing open-source wallets, for example, don’t offer any customer support. If you think you will require help with your wallet, choose one that allows you to interact with a human customer support agent via telephone or live chat.
How important is security?
Are you just looking to test the waters in the brave new world of crypto? Or are you looking to make a substantial investment? Depending on your plans, security will either play a relatively small or a very big factor in choosing a wallet.
You may be looking for a desktop wallet you can secure with an encryption password. Or maybe you want the best security that crypto storage solutions can offer.
Backing up your wallet is one of the most important aspects of crypto wallet management. Are you content with writing down and safely storing a recovery phrase, or do you prefer to only have to remember a username and password?
Choosing a wallet with a backup feature that works for you is another essential security measure when it comes to picking a wallet.
How important is it to have ownership of your private key?
Are you comfortable with a third-party provider holding your wallet’s private keys (and thus having de facto ownership of your virtual assets)? If not, you can choose a non-custodial wallet where you are responsible for managing your wallet’s private keys.
While these wallets are considered best practice because you have complete control over your virtual assets, if you lose access to your wallet or forget your encryption password, you will lose all funds held in that wallet.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is a Cryptocurrency Wallet? A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to store the unique digital codes needed to send and receive crypto assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. It’s important to reinforce that these wallets don’t store your actual cryptocurrencies, despite what their name may lead you to believe. Cryptocurrency wallets are actually more of a ledger, since they hold the keys to the owner’s identity, allowing them access to a blockchain network and transaction history. These wallets must locate the cryptocurrency associated with your address across the blockchain, which is why they must interact with it.
What are the Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets? Software, hardware, and paper wallets are the three major types of cryptocurrency wallets that fall under the two main categories of wallets known as hot and cold wallets. Cold wallets have no connection to the internet and come in some physical form, such as a hard drive or a piece of paper, making them the most secure wallets possible. Hot wallets, on the other hand, do have some form of an internet connection, which causes them to be more susceptible to security breaches. Hot wallets are favored for their flexibility, such as the ability to access your funds or trade on the go. These software wallets come in the form of web wallets, desktop wallets, and mobile app wallets. It’s important to reinforce, however, that this availability comes as the result of a hot wallet’s web connectivity, which inherently leaves your funds open to some form of vulnerability. In the case of cold wallets, the only way for your funds to be lost is if the wallet itself is either lost or stolen and no backup procedures have been put in place. Unfortunately, this superior level of security does not allow for your funds to be readily available for trading or commerce while away from your computer. Most leading crypto wallets today are hybrid wallets that offer desktop and mobile access, with the option to connect to a hardware wallet for maximum backup protection.
How do Cryptocurrency Wallets Work? Cryptocurrency wallets provide public keys and private keys to enable crypto users to interact with their digital assets stored on public blockchain networks. A wallet’s public key is the wallet address you can receive funds to and the private key is what you use to access your funds to make transactions. Think of the public key as your bank account number and the private key as your bank account PIN that you use to log in and make payments.
Methodology
One of the most important things to consider before you transact in and store cryptocurrencies is that you have a suitable crypto wallet in place. To help determine the wallet that works best for you, we conducted a comprehensive review process of the top cryptocurrency software wallets.
Our review process is built around a quantitative ratings model that weighs key factors like security, costs, privacy, usability, customer support, and features according to their importance. Our team of researchers gathered over 40 data points and conducted extensive research for each of the 19 companies we reviewed. Our team of writers, who are experts in this field, then test drove each wallet to lend their qualitative point of view.
Our model gave preference to companies with the strongest security measures and reputations. Companies with rich features, such as supporting a large number of crypto assets, giving users the ability to sync with hardware wallets, and allowing for fee customization, also ranked highly.

The Financial Stability Bureau of the Chinese central bank released a comprehensive note on Wednesday discussing the impact of the crypto crackdown on the financial markets. The official notice claimed that all peer-to-peer exchanges in the country had been eradicated, which eventually curbed the hype around digital currency transactions.
A Google translated version of the note read:
“The global proportion of Bitcoin transactions in China dropped rapidly from more than 90% to 10%. Severely cracked down on illegal financial activities such as disorderly handling of finance and crackdown on illegal fund-raising crimes.”
China is among the few nations that have maintained an outright aggressive stance against crypto use since the beginning. The country’s first ban came in 2013 when it prohibited banks from handling Bitcoin transactions.
This was followed by a ban on local cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017, forcing them to shut their operations completely. The country later ramped up its crypto crackdown efforts in 2021, when it carried out multiple regulatory operations to eradicate Bitcoin mining from the country and by September 2021, it had deemed all crypto transactions illegal.

According to data from Statista, the annual share of Bitcoin trading volume in the digital yuan has dropped to near zero by 2018, post a ban on cryptocurrency exchanges.

The trading volume of BTC in the Chinese yuan might have dropped down to near zero, but the decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it impossible to ban.
After a ban on local crypto exchanges in 2017, many Chinese traders turned to foreign crypto exchanges via VPN. When the Beijing government banned foreign crypto exchanges from offering any services in mainland China as well, the Chinese traders flocked to decentralized finance (DeFi) for anonymous trading."

Donations in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum are pouring into Ukraine as the war with Russia enters its second week.
Since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24, more than 102,000 cryptoasset donations, totaling $54.7 million, have gone to the Ukrainian government and Come Back Alive, an NGO providing support to the military, according to new data from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The raise includes a single donation of $5.8 million from Gavin Wood, the founder of a lesser-known cryptocurrency called polkadot.
Donations have picked up this week, with around 72,000 of these donations coming in the past two days. Thus far, the contributions consist of $18.2 million in ether, $17.2 million in bitcoin and $9.5 million in a mix of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, including an anonymous donation of $1 million in tether, a controversial token designed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.
Accepting donations in crypto is new for the Ukrainian government. Up until Saturday, all donations had to travel via traditional payment channels, but on Feb. 26, the government decided to get creative.
Twitter accounts belonging to the Ukrainian government began to solicit cryptoasset donations for the first time. The move came after the country's central bank cracked down on digital money transfers in connection with a nationwide declaration of martial law.
Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have become more popular since they allow users to bypass financial institutions that might block payments to Ukraine.
Elliptic says that the bitcoin, ethereum, tron, polkadot, dogecoin and solana addresses listed in the tweets have received over 96,000 cryptocurrency donations, with a total value of $46.7 million going directly to the government.
""Cryptocurrency is particularly suited to international fundraising because it doesn't respect national boundaries and it's censorship-resistant — there is no central authority that can block transactions, for example in response to sanctions,"" said Elliptic's chief scientist, Tom Robinson.
Donations of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, have also surged.
One CryptoPunk NFT worth over $200,000 was sent to the Ukrainian government's ethereum account, and Elliptic says that a single transaction worth $1.86 million looks to have come from the sale of NFTs originally intended to raise funds for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.
Meanwhile, UkraineDAO has auctioned off an NFT of the Ukrainian flag for $6.5 million in ether, which makes it among the most expensive NFT ever sold. Elliptic says that the proceeds are to be donated to Come Back Alive.
But even as cryptocurrencies open up new paths to cash for a country fighting off a major offensive, the numbers pale by comparison to the cash flowing into the country from international allies such as the U.S.
In addition to the $350 million that the White House authorized in military aid to Ukraine, the Biden administration is asking Congress for $10 billion in immediate emergency aid to bolster humanitarian supplies, security forces, and the economies in Ukraine and its central European partners. Meanwhile, USAID has pledged another $54 million in humanitarian aid to Kyiv."

In simple words, blockchain in the context of crypto",https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-how-does-it-work/,"Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money that is based on blockchain technology and secured by cryptography. To understand cryptocurrency, one needs to first understand three terminologies – blockchain, decentralization, and cryptography.
In simple words, blockchain in the context of cryptocurrency is a digital ledger whose access is distributed among authorized users. This ledger records transactions related to a range of assets, like money, house, or even intellectual property.
The access is shared between its users and any information shared is transparent, immediate, and “immutable”. Immutable means anything that blockchain records is there for good and cannot be modified or tampered with – even by an administrator.
Centralized money refers to the regular money that we use, which is governed by authorities like the Reserve Bank of India. Decentralization in cryptocurrency means there is no similar authority that can be held responsible for supervising the rise and fall of a particular cryptocurrency. This has many benefits over centralized money.
Some of these benefits include the following:
There is no need for currency owners to “trust” a single governing entity, as everyone in the network has access to the same information that cannot be altered.
Data remains accessible only to the users of the network and it is heavily secured. Shared ownership also means all users sign off on how accurate the data is, which means there is very little scope for data mismanagement or miscommunication. Think of it as a democracy.
Security, which is a fundamental part of a blockchain.
Cryptography is the method that secures data from unauthorized access by the use of encryption techniques. Most of the claims that blockchain makes, like privacy and immutability, are enabled through cryptography.
The roots of cryptocurrency technology can be traced back to the 1980s with the invention of what is called a “blinding algorithm”. The algorithm is all about secure and immutable digital transactions. It remains fundamental to the modern-day digital currency.
In 2008, a group of people (currently known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto) created the guiding principles of the first and leading cryptocurrency in the market today, Bitcoin. In 2009, Bitcoin was launched to the world. But it would be years before it was formally recognized as a means of payment among leading merchants, starting with WordPress in 2012.
The underlying blockchain technology is today used in banking, insurance, and other business sectors. Growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 12.8% since 2021, the cryptocurrency market is estimated to reach $4.94 billion by 2030, thanks to the need to improve the efficiency of today’s payment systems, rise in global remittances and increased need to secure data.
How Does Cryptocurrency Work?
Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by the government or central regulatory authorities. As a concept, cryptocurrency works outside of the banking system using different brands or types of coins – Bitcoin being the major player.
1. Mining
Cryptocurrencies (which are completely digital) are generated through a process called “mining”. This is a complex process. Basically, miners are required to solve certain mathematical puzzles over specially equipped computer systems to be rewarded with bitcoins in exchange.
In an ideal world, it would take a person just 10 minutes to mine one bitcoin, but in reality, the process takes an estimated 30 days.
2. Buying, selling, and storing
Users today can buy cryptocurrencies from central exchanges, brokers, and individual currency owners or sell it to them. Exchanges or platforms like Coinbase are the easiest ways to buy or sell cryptocurrencies.
Once bought, cryptocurrencies can be stored in digital wallets. Digital wallets can be “hot” or “cold”. Hot means the wallet is connected to the internet, which makes it easy to transact, but vulnerable to thefts and frauds. Cold storage, on the other hand, is safer but makes it harder to transact.
3. Transacting or investing
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins can be easily transferred from one digital wallet to another, using only a smartphone. Once you own them, your choices are to:
a) use them to buy goods or services
b) trade in them
c) exchange them for cash
If you are using Bitcoin for purchases, the easiest way to do that is through debit-card-type transactions. You can also use these debit cards to withdraw cash, just like at an ATM. Converting cryptocurrency to cash is also possible using banking accounts or peer-to-peer transactions.
Types of Cryptocurrencies
There are tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies available today with the figure pegged at 10,000 in 2022. Major cryptocurrencies include the following:
Bitcoin
Bitcoin is the world’s first widely accepted form of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is so popular, there was a time when its name was synonymous with cryptocurrency. But potential investors need to know bitcoins have become very expensive. In 2021, the cost of one Bitcoin was $68,000. But the good news is, you don’t always have to buy an entire coin, you can buy smaller fractions of it.
Altcoin
Altcoin is the term used for any alternative digital currency to bitcoin. The most popular in this ecosystem is Ethereum – one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in the market. There is also a range of other altcoins in the market today such as Luckyblock, Shiba Inu and Terra.
Crypto tokens
The concept of crypto coins vs tokens can be confusing to many. At first glance, coins and tokens appear the same. However, the two have many differences
Coins can be mined, but tokens cannot be mined.
Coins are linked to blockchains, tokens are not.
In terms of utility, they vary in the type of product or service they allow users to purchase.
Should You Invest In Cryptocurrency?
There are many advantages to dealing in cryptocurrencies, and a fair share of disadvantages as well. Here are the top three reasons that work in favor of and against cryptocurrencies.
Advantages:
They are private and secure: The blockchain technology that fuels cryptocurrencies ensures user anonymity. It also assures high levels of security through cryptography, which we discussed before.
They are decentralized, immutable, and transparent: The entire system functions on shared ownership, where data is available to all permissioned members and is tamper-proof.
They are a hedge against inflation: Cryptocurrency makes for a great investment in times of inflation. For example, investors often compare cryptocurrency to gold. One of the reasons behind this is that, just like gold, they are in limited supply, as there is a cap on mining any type of cryptocurrency.
Disadvantages:
They are not widely understood: They are a relatively new concept and the long-term sustainability of cryptocurrencies remains to be seen.
They are prone to high risks: Needless to say, cryptocurrencies bring in as many rewards as risks. Their highly volatile and speculative nature makes them prone to sharp downward spirals. Investing in cryptocurrency can be risky for many reasons.
A major deterrent could be the fact that digital currency seems to have no inherent or underlying value. There is a supply-demand type of equation that is used to determine the value of cryptos like bitcoins.
Plus, it is easy to see how simple speculations over the internet can result in a substantial rise or loss of value of these coins.
Also the fact that cryptocurrencies are banned or their usage restricted in a lot of countries plays out as a significant risk. Their legality is debatable in countries like India.
Scalability is a problem: This is a complex issue, which has more to do with the technology side of the blockchain. Simply put, the sluggish nature of the blockchain makes it prone to transactional delays. This has the tendency to make crypto payments inefficient when compared to modern-day electronic payment techniques.
Cryptocurrency in India
Until the 2022 Union Budget announcement, the fate of cryptocurrency in India was largely undecided.
In the Budget, the Indian Finance Minister’s announcement on levying a 30% tax on gains on the transfer of virtual digital assets, which includes cryptocurrency, was initially seen as an endorsement of cryptocurrencies. It set off the debate on whether or not the tax on cryptocurrency indicates the government has recognized it as a legitimate form of currency.
However, this isn’t true and there have also been speculations that a ban on private cryptocurrencies would follow the launch of the RBI’s own official digital currency. Something to this effect was openly stated by RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar in February 2022, when he said it was advisable for India to ban cryptocurrency. Will this turn out to be similar to the government’s ban on cryptocurrency in 2018 (which was overturned by India’s Supreme Court in 2020) remains to be seen.
Bottom Line
Whether cryptocurrency is the future of money or not, one thing is clear: It is not advisable for anyone to invest in it without doing enough research. Investing in cryptocurrencies is not a new phenomenon. But with the recent surge in popularity and value, coupled with falling returns on bank deposits, more people are looking for cryptocurrency advice.
If you have decided to invest in cryptocurrencies, ensure that you start with the leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as newer ones may not have sufficient liquidity (you may not be able to sell them when you want to). The market is rife with scamsters. Hence using authorized platforms to buy or trade cryptos is important, especially while starting out.
Investing in cryptocurrency is a risky venture. You need to be aware that there is a high chance of losing your money. If you are not comfortable with the risk, it’s better to stay away from it. There are many ways you can profit from cryptocurrency – buying coins, trading coins, mining coins, and so on. The last one requires the maximum resources but also has the potential for higher returns while buying or trading can be done more easily.
Cryptocurrencies are also highly volatile, so it is recommended to start small and diversify your investments. Simply put, do not place all your eggs in one basket. As a beginner, it helps if you initially rely on expert advice and gradually grow your own expertise by researching the subject. For this type of research to be successful, it is also important to develop an understanding of your country’s historic and current policies on cryptocurrency. And as always, don’t invest more than you can afford to lose."

Cryptocurrencies are playing a role on both sides of the conflict caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Their ability to cross borders regardless of rules or regulations is helping Ukrainian refugees move money out of the country, but may also provide a way for Russian elites to sidestep crippling economic sanctions.
The Ukrainian government, in desperate need of equipment, tweeted a call for donations in bitcoin and Ethereum immediately after the invasion last month. As of 4 March, Ukraine’s bitcoin wallet had received more than £7.5 million, while its Ethereum wallet had received £3.2 million.
Unlike funds raised by non-governmental organisations and charities, these were available to the Ukrainian government within minutes. Other crowdfunding efforts haven’t been so simple. The online fundraising service Patreon blocked an account raising money for Ukraine that had attracted more than 14,000 donors pledging a monthly total of more than £300,000 because fundraisers linked to weapons violate Patreon’s policies – the various levels of donation were called things such as “bullet” and “bomb”. Instead, the group that organised the Patreon page, Come Back Alive, later sold an NFT (non-fungible token) of the Ukrainian flag for nearly £5 million to raise funds.

Before the war broke out, Ukraine was already well placed to raise funds in this way. Last month, its parliament officially legalised cryptocurrency, although it stopped short of adopting any as legal tender, as El Salvador has done.
Dmytro, a computer programmer from Lviv who works for a cryptocurrency mining company and asked that his surname be withheld for security reasons, told New Scientist that he had managed to escape the fighting in Ukraine thanks to bitcoin.
He woke on 24 February to news of the invasion and found cash machine payouts limited by emergency laws, and huge queues to withdraw money. International bank transfers had also been banned. He managed to transfer all his available money into bitcoin and escape with his girlfriend over the border to Poland. He would otherwise have been conscripted into the army, he says. “Bitcoin saved my life.”

Dmytro is now in Poland, using his technical skills to oversee a group of 50 volunteers subverting Russian propaganda online and encouraging Russians to protest against the war. “They have their propaganda, but we have our truth. And as soon as people know the truth, they will definitely go to protests,” he says. “This way we can stop the war as soon as possible.”
Russians have also been converting their money to bitcoin as the value of the rouble plummets after global sanctions strangled Russia’s economy. Demand for bitcoin has been so high that it has been trading there at a premium above global prices. There are simply more people looking to buy than there are people trying to sell who can, or will, accept Russian roubles.
There are fears that Russia’s wealthy elite and those connected to Putin will use similar tactics to remove their money from the country to circumvent sanctions. But George Lopez at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana says that any Russian oligarch using a Swiss bank – long a favourite storage option because of the country’s strict banking privacy laws – and hoping to cash in millions of dollars worth of bitcoin would be likely to appear on the radar of numerous watchful Western governments.
He believes that while countries such as North Korea have been able to establish complex global networks to work around sanctions so they can move funds and goods using bitcoin, Russia has had no time to prepare. “Every bank is very, very suspicious of reasonably large transfers from anybody who’s trying to convert into euros or dollars who hasn’t been a prior customer,” he says.
Russian companies are now isolated from the global banking system, and will also find it difficult to deal with foreigners using bitcoin payments, says Lopez, because the receiving party will eventually have to convert into their own currency, which would trigger financial investigations. Put simply, large amounts of unexplained money are getting harder to put into banks under the current scrutiny.
European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde urged the European Union to push ahead with its Markets in Crypto-Assets legislation that was designed to regulate the trade in cryptocurrency, to aid efforts to prevent Russian cash disappearing into bitcoin. Ukraine’s vice prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has also called for cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze Russian accounts. “It’s crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users,” he tweeted.
Although some exchanges such as Gopax have blocked accounts belonging to Russians on official sanction lists, there are few willing to take stronger action, leaving the libertarian-leaning industry standing alone while companies such as Apple, Nike and Ford withdraw services and products from Russia.
A spokesperson for Kraken, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, told New Scientist that it was abiding by all sanctions against Russia, but the company’s CEO Jesse Powell said on Twitter that it would go no further. “If we were going to voluntarily freeze financial accounts of residents of countries unjustly attacking and provoking violence around the world, step one would be to freeze all US accounts,” he wrote. “That’s not really a viable business option for us.”
The value of the rouble against the US dollar has dropped 20 per cent from the start of the year to 4 March. And while there have been reports of bitcoin soaring since the day of the invasion – it is up 20.7 per cent as of 4 March from the day of the invasion – it had seen an equally large fall in the preceding week.
It is hard to ascribe any movement in bitcoin’s price solely to the invasion of Ukraine, but in this crisis, cryptocurrencies are proving to be a more stable bet than the Russian rouble.

Burger King ran a Dogecoin giveaway with Robinhood in 2021.
First it was celebrities like Megan Thee Stallion and Aaron Rodgers offering you free Bitcoin through Block's Cash App.
Now the promos are getting a little less sexy. That's because we're in the fast food phase of the hype cycle.
Burger chain Shake Shack has announced that for every purchase made with a Cash App debit card through March, it will refund customers 15% of the equivalent total in Bitcoin.
The promotion isn't a response to patrons clamoring for crypto-with-cheese, according to CMO Jay Livingston. He told The Wall Street Journal that it's an easy way to see whether cryptocurrency has any traction with the chain's customers: “You’re always trying to place your bets on those things that truly will be meaningful and not waste resources on the ones that won’t.""
It's not an entirely new area for restaurants to venture into. In November, Robinhood and Burger King teamed up to give customers 1 Dogecoin (currently trading for about 12 cents) every time they spent $5, while McDonald's has been making NFT Big Macs that are tastier than the real thing.
While Shack Shack is frying—er, trying—to feel out the crypto space, Block is a well-established patron of Bitcoin. Under CEO Jack Dorsey's leadership, the company has pushed Bitcoin (though not other crypto assets). Its Spiral brand (formerly Square Crypto) has pumped out software developer kits for Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, while the TBD54566975 division (yes, that's its real name) is working on a Bitcoin-based decentralized exchange.
Cash App has been busiest of all. In addition to rolling out Lightning transactions in January, it's been collaborating with celebrities to encourage people to buy Bitcoin via the app. Recently, for example, Oscar-winning actress and lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow gave away $500,000 in the company's Bitcoin to her Instagram and Twitter followers who commented on her posts with a ""$cashtag.""
Paltrow's personal brand would likely implode were she to be caught at a Shake Shack, but the restaurant chain is nonetheless looking to capture some of Block's social media marketing strategy to reach younger customer groups.
In that case, maybe Shack Shack should be giving out Shiba Inu."
158,2022-03-04,2022-03-04,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Joseph Hall,cointelegraph.com,Bitcoin mining difficulty drops for the first time this year,The Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment correction means that miners might find it slightly easier to compete for validating blocks.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-drops-for-the-first-time-this-year,"For the first time since November 2021, the Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty adjustment has dropped, correcting 1.49%. The move follows a succession of six consecutive positive difficulty adjustments, in which the mining difficulty and hash rate hit all-time highs.
The average hash rate over the past two weeks fell to 197.19 exahashes per second (EH/s), making the average block time exceed the 10-minute target at 10 minutes 9 seconds. As a result of the difficulty adjustment, miners competing to solve the next valid block found it marginally easier.
Bitcoin mining difficulty marginally dropping after an 8 month climb. Source: Glassnode
The difficulty adjustment is one of the Bitcoin protocol’s most prominent features. Every two weeks or 2,016 confirmed blocks, the difficulty for mining a new block “adjusts” based on the average of the past 2,016 blocks, making it easier or more difficult to mine blocks.
From the Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto wrote, “the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.”
By inference, over the past 2,016 blocks, blocks were generated too slowly at an average of 10 minutes 9 seconds. As a result, the difficulty adjustment automatically decreases and miners will, henceforth, find it marginally easier to solve valid blocks over the next 2,016 blocks.
According to Denver Bitcoin, a well-known Bitcoin miner, the -1.49% correction could be the only one for the year.
Bitcoin just had its first downward difficulty adjustment of 2022.
Will it be the only downward adjustment of the year?
Experts still calling for 300eh+ average by December.

A correction of 1.49% dwindles compared to the mining dark ages of May to July of 2021, when a ban on Bitcoin mining in China caused a catastrophic drop in the hash rate. Thankfully, it swiftly climbed up over the course of 2021, surging by 31% as countries like Kazakhstan and Canada picked up the slack, proving the network’s resilience.
The Bitcoin mining industry is increasingly competitive, with tech industry players including Intel keen on making a dent in the hash rate and introducing their own miners. As Denver Bitcoin alluded, the 300 Eh/s hash rate could be an attainable goal in 2022, particularly as mining shows growing resilience and geographic flexibility."

The Central Bank of Brazil and Fenasbac, the National Federation of Associations of Central Bank Servers, decided to select nine projects to monitor and support their different proposals for the application of a hypothetical Brazilian central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital real. Projects from companies and organizations like Aave, Banco Santander, and Mercado Bitcoin were selected to be developed as examples of how a digital real could be used.
LIFT Challenge Selects Nine Digital Real Projects
The LIFT challenge, an initiative organized by Fenasbac and the Central Bank of Brazil, has selected nine projects which present different ideas on how a future digital real CBDC (central bank digital currency) might be inserted into several applications. The Laboratory of Financial and Technological Innovations (LIFT) decided that these nine projects were the most interesting, selected out of 47 proposals presented by 43 organizations.
The challenge attracted the attention of companies from all over the world, including proposals by organizations from Germany, the United States, Israel, Mexico, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. Regarding the criteria used to select these projects and reject others, the central bank stated:
[The central bank] sought a balance between the diversity of the portfolio of proposals presented to the laboratory and the need for detailed monitoring of the chosen projects.
Project Diversity
The nine projects approved are very different one from another, and seek to include the digital real into different applications that include delivery versus payment solutions, payment versus payment solutions, internet of things (IoT), defi applications, and also dual offline payment proposals.
The nine selected proposals were presented by Aave, Banco Santander Brasil, Febraban, Giesecke + Devrient, Itaú Unibanco, Bitcoin Market, Tecban, VERT, and Visa do Brasil. Giesecke + Devrient’s proposal, for example, seeks to use the CDBC as a tool to solve the problem of dual offline payments.
Aave, the decentralized finance protocol, also presented a project that would focus on offering loans while ensuring compliance of these operations with the rules of the financial system, using defi tools like liquidity pools. Itau’s Unibanco project will center on using the currency to handle international payments, linking this with the development of an application for Colombian users. The application of Visa do Brasil would leverage the token for financing SMEs with a defi application.
The Central Bank of Brazil seeks to study all of these applications to deepen its understanding of the uses of a digital currency with the idea of creating its own digital currency in the future, according to a press release.

Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, a bitcoin skeptic, admits he has not been right on his crypto call. He now says: “It’s fair to assume that over the months to come, you will see us engage in making markets in cryptocurrencies.”
Market Maker Citadel Securities Getting Into Crypto
The founder of hedge fund Citadel and market maker Citadel Securities, billionaire Ken Griffin, talked about cryptocurrency and his company’s decision to enter the space in an interview with David Rubenstein on Bloomberg Thursday.
The billionaire executive has long been a bitcoin skeptic. He previously described the rush to embrace cryptocurrencies as a “jihadist call” against the U.S. dollar. In 2017, he told CNBC that bitcoin has “many of the elements of the tulip bulb mania.” He also said: “I get very worried that people that are buying bitcoins don’t really understand what they’re participating in.”
Griffin made headlines in November last year when he bought a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution at a Sotheby’s auction for $43.2 million, beating out ConstitutionDAO.
He was asked whether Citadel has plans to trade or make markets in crypto. “To the extent that we’re trying to help institutions and investors solve their portfolio allocation problems, we have to give serious consideration to being a market maker in crypto,” he replied, elaborating:
It’s fair to assume that over the months to come, you will see us engage in making markets in cryptocurrencies.
In 1990, Griffin founded Citadel, one of the largest hedge funds with more than $38 billion in assets under management, where he currently serves as the CEO. In 2002, he established Citadel Securities, the largest market maker in stocks, options, and interest rate swaps for retail and institutional clients. The firm handles 40% of all stock trades in the U.S.
Griffin also admitted Thursday that he has not been right about his crypto call.
“Crypto has been one of the great stories in finance over the course of the last 15 years. And I’ll be clear, I’ve been in the naysayer camp over that period of time,” the CEO shared, adding:
But the crypto market today has a market capitalization of about $2 trillion in round numbers, which tells you that I haven’t been right on this call.
Nonetheless, the Citadel CEO clarified: “I still have my skepticism, but there are hundreds and millions of people in this world today who disagree with that.”

Bitcoin has fallen below $40,000 to start the weekend, as cryptocurrency markets extend recent losses. ETH was also lower on Saturday, falling to its lowest point this week in the process.
Bitcoin
BTC fell for its fourth consecutive session on Saturday, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped below its long-term support level.
The price of BTC/USD fell below its $40,000 floor during the session, hitting an intraday low of $38,777.04 in the process.
As of writing, BTC is down 5.27% on the day, and is currently trading at $39,151.54, with the 14-day RSI tracking at 45.4.
This decline in price strength comes as the floor of 47 within the RSI indicator was broken, and is now trading at its lowest since last Sunday.
As prices continue to fall, traders are naturally looking to find a stable floor, which appears to be around the $37,600 region.
However, as established on Friday, a rebound could also be imminent, as bulls historically have lived in the current price range.
Ethereum
Unlike bitcoin, ETH appears to have found its floor to start the weekend, despite also falling to its lowest level in the last seven days.
Earlier in today’s session, ETH/USD hit an intraday low of $2,587.75, however these losses have somewhat eased, and ethereum is now trading at $2,645.77.
This is marginally lower than today’s peak of $2,705.25, however as Saturday’s session matures, many remain hopeful of increases in price.
The floor of $2,550 seems to be the target of bears, which have been firmly present since prices were trading at the $3,000 resistance point.
History has shown that bulls tend to rally at the current level, as seen the last few times we were at this support point around $2,600.
Could we see prices recover heading into Sunday? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

The American fast-food restaurant chain Shake Shack is giving bitcoin rewards to customers leveraging Cash App’s debit card payment rail, Cash Card. According to Shake Shack, participants will get 15% of their purchase back in the form of bitcoin, and the crypto promotion will last until mid-March.
Shake Shack Experiments With Bitcoin Trial to Lure Millennial and Gen Z Customers
The fast-food restaurant chain Shake Shack is experimenting with cryptocurrency rewards as the company has partnered with Block Inc. in order to give away bitcoin (BTC). The announcement stems from a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report authored by Ann-Marie Alcántara and Shake Shack explained the move is meant to lure younger customers.
Executives at the burger chain told Alcántara that while it’s looking to attract millennial and Gen Z-age customers, Shake Shack is also “interested in more cryptocurrency options.” The offer will give Shake Shack consumers the ability to receive 15% of their purchase back, but paid in bitcoin. Essentially, customers need to leverage Block’s Cash Card and Cash Boost system in order to get the BTC reward.
Jay Livingston, Shake Shack’s chief marketing officer, told the WSJ reporter that the fast-food restaurant chain has not seen demand for crypto payments. However, Livingston said the experiment with the Block’s Cash App is a good way to determine whether the restaurant should accept digital assets.
“You’re always trying to place your bets on those things that truly will be meaningful and not waste resources on the ones that won’t,” Livingston told Alcántara. “If we just started taking crypto right now at our kiosk, it would have very low adoption. But through someone like Cash App, who’s been promoting it, you will get some more people that want it and that also want to learn,” the Shake Shack CMO noted.
Shake Shack is not the first to test the waters with crypto solutions as Burger King (BK) and Robinhood gave a single dogecoin (DOGE) reward to BK consumers for spending $5. Robinhood and BK also distributed 20 bitcoin and 200 ether during the rewards event timeline.
McDonald’s has yet to trial crypto payments but the fast-food giant has been testing non-fungible token (NFT) technology. For instance, McDonald’s introduced the cult-classic “McRib” NFT collectible last November, and McDonald’s France tweeted out images of NFTs in April.

Miller likens Bitcoin to digital gold when it comes to the digital currency. Other cryptos are simply “adventure investments” since they lack the uniqueness of Bitcoin, he said.
A fund manager, Miller highlighted that nearly half of Russia’s reserves are held in currencies controlled by individuals seeking to do them damage.
Miller, a co-founder of Miller Value Partners, spoke on the future of crypto in the face of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Crypto Outlook Favorable For Stakeholders
“The rest of crypto is a different story,” he said. The remainder of the cryptos could be called “adventure investments” since he believes they are all attempting to tackle different challenges.
The renowned value investor has been a long-term advocate of bitcoin. Last month, he revealed he had “a substantial” amount of bitcoin, and compared it to digital gold as a hedge against inflation.
He also referred to the current crypto outlook and Bitcoin as “insurance against financial disaster.”
Miller’s deep knowledge of investing and the stock market holds weight because of his vast business experience.

Russian Sanctions Good For Bitcoin?
Russia has 16% of its $640 billion in reserves in dollars, with 32% of assets denominated in euros.
According to Miller, they have 22% of their reserves in gold, which is the only component other nations cannot seize. He said:
“I believe this is very bullish for bitcoin.”
Several nations have slapped Russia with all sorts of sanctions since it attacked Ukraine.
As a result, the Russian currency and the stock prices of Russian enterprises listed on foreign exchanges have fallen precipitously.
European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen did not mince words, last week:
“We will paralyze the assets of Russia’s central bank.”
This announcement is expected to result in transactions being suspended and, in effect, will render the central bank unable to dispose of its assets.
War Drives Bitcoin Up: Devere CEO
Meanwhile, the CEO of Devere Group, Nigel Green, also shares the same level of optimism and has predicted that bitcoin’s price will reach $50,000 by the end of this month if the current outlook for the crypto is to be the gauge.
Bitcoin is now trading at $39,007. Green believes that the dollar’s standing as a global reserve currency might be threatened if viable and practical alternatives, such as cryptocurrency, emerge.

He said that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has prompted people, corporations, and government agencies throughout the world to explore “alternatives to traditional systems” in response to the war.
According to Green, Bitcoin is now the 14th most valuable currency in the world, and he thinks it will rise much higher in the rankings in the coming months.
He said:
“Smart investors recognize this and will increase their exposure to cryptocurrencies before prices further climb.”
The Devere boss believes geopolitical tensions and institutional investors are driving the price of the (still) most sought-after crypto in the world.

While the S&P 500 produced a total return close to 100% over the past five years, cryptocurrencies have gone from a total market value of $24.5 billion in March 2017 to $1.8 trillion today.
The top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 2.78%), has unsurprisingly garnered a lot of attention as digital assets march toward mainstream adoption. And as it becomes a daily topic of discussion in the financial news, there is no shortage of price targets out there.
Can Bitcoin, whose value currently hovers around $40,000 per coin, hit the $100,000 mark? Let's take a closer look.
Bitcoin is becoming a legitimate store of value
With its ability to support decentralized applications, Ethereum rightfully receives attention as it offers up real-world cryptocurrency use cases. On the other hand, Bitcoin has firmly become more of a store of value in the world of digital assets. Launched in 2009, it has the longest history. And it now carries a market cap of $734 billion (as of March 7).
This longevity has resulted in the development of financial infrastructure to make it extremely easy to buy Bitcoin. There are exchange-traded funds to purchase the world's top cryptocurrency. Additionally, businesses like Block, PayPal Holdings, and Coinbase Global have made it incredibly simple to gain exposure to Bitcoin.
According to research from crypto.com, there were 300 million cryptocurrency users worldwide at the end of 2021. And by the end of 2022, that number could be 1 billion. Since most people's first exposure to cryptocurrencies is to purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum, the potential for massive buying pressure is definitely there as new investors enter the crypto economy.
And it's not hard to imagine a scenario where more countries follow in El Salvador's footsteps to establish Bitcoin as legal tender. Furthermore, large organizations, including governments, institutional investors, and corporations, could choose to convert some of their cash holdings to Bitcoin. Combined, these trends could easily propel Bitcoin past $100,000.
Famed investor Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest, which is known for making eye-popping predictions, thinks Bitcoin could eclipse $1 million per coin by 2030. Her company's target depends on a lot of things happening, like more countries accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, greater institutional and corporate ownership, and a higher share of the global remittance market. This is the most optimistic scenario in my opinion, so investors should temper expectations to get a more accurate picture.
Bitcoin makes sense for long-term investors
I'm bullish on the entire crypto economy, so making the decision to allocate a small portion (1% to 2%) of a well-diversified portfolio to Bitcoin seems like a no-brainer to me. Cryptocurrencies have endured numerous ""crypto winters"" in recent years, only to come raging back stronger. And some of the best and brightest minds are leaving lucrative jobs in traditional tech and finance to work at crypto start-ups. These factors give me confidence that cryptocurrencies will only become a bigger part of our lives in the years ahead.
Perhaps the biggest bear argument is the threat of governments banning cryptocurrencies (like China did last year). But in the U.S., both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair (SEC) Gary Gensler have publicly stated that they don't intend to make cryptocurrencies illegal. This bodes well for supporters of digital assets.
Therefore, it's difficult to see a future where Bitcoin doesn't appreciate in value. It certainly won't be a smooth ride, and investors can expect tremendous volatility along the way. But with the continued proliferation of necessary financial infrastructure, as well as much-needed regulatory clarity, I believe Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is a likely scenario.
And at that price, Bitcoin's total market cap would approach $2 trillion. According to consultancy McKinsey, global wealth today is in the neighborhood of $500 trillion. It's not unreasonable to see Bitcoin represent half of a percent of that figure.
If I had to put a time frame on it, I'd say it could happen within five years, which would produce an annualized return of roughly 20%. Compared to Bitcoin's trailing five-year return of 3,000%, this is a major slowdown. Nonetheless, the potential to outpace the stock market is very high."
167,2022-03-08,2022-03-08,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,coingeek.com,"Hey Patrick Bet-David, Michael Saylor is wrong about Bitcoin",The only conclusion that can be reasonably drawn from the PBD Podcast episode with Michael Saylor is that he is either being deliberately deceptive or has failed to grasp even the basics of Bitcoin.,https://coingeek.com/hey-patrick-bet-david-michael-saylor-is-wrong-about-bitcoin/,"Dear Patrick Bet-David,
I recently listened to your PBD Podcast episode with Michael Saylor. I commend you on always keeping an open mind and being willing to address such a wide variety of people on your show, but after listening to the Saylor episode, I felt compelled to pen this article to correct some misconceptions and falsehoods he promoted during this episode.
I will handle Saylor’s arguments one by one, but not necessarily in the order that he made them on your show. This is because there are some points that tie together from different parts of the podcast.
Saylor has the basic nature of Bitcoin completely wrong
I’ve listened to several of Saylor’s interviews, and as he did on your show, he always begins by promoting a fundamental falsehood about what Bitcoin is. It is not a pristine form of property, a hedge against inflation, or an unconfiscatable version of digital gold.
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that facilitates small, casual transactions. How do I know this? Because I read the Bitcoin white paper (it’s literally written in the title) and I also studied the words of Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. He mentions micropayments in his very first public post and speaks of small, casual transactions in his white paper. No offense to Saylor, but I’m inclined to believe Satoshi Nakamoto when it comes to the subject of what Bitcoin is.
However, even if we allow that BTC is some form of digital property and has evolved and changed over a decade, there are several problems with Saylor’s arguments in favor of it as a superior asset.
1. Never more than 21 million BTC
Saylor promotes the notion that BTC is some sort of absolutely scarce asset that is hard-capped at 21 million coins. This is a myth promoted by BTC maximalists far and wide, but it’s not true.
First of all, the framing of BTC as rare because of the 21 million number is a deliberate choice. Why look at it from the perspective of whole coins and not Satoshi units, of which there are quadrillions? This choice to look at BTC from a whole coin perspective suits the agenda of those who wish to promote BTC as some rare asset, which is exactly why they choose to focus on the 21 million number.
However, even this ultimate hard cap is not necessarily true. Due to problems caused by BTC developers’ insistence on keeping blocks small and how this impacts the economics of the Bitcoin system, BTC protocol developers like Peter Todd have already begun floating the idea of increasing BTCs supply via inflation. I’ll cover mining economics in more detail below.
Ultimately it’s a myth that there can only ever be 21 million BTC units. All it takes is a code change to inflate BTC, and if history shows us anything, it’s that when BTC core developers want to change something, they’ll get their way by any means necessary.
2. BTC is not unconfiscatable
One of the key arguments that Saylor likes to make is that BTC is not confiscatable by governments. He told you the same story I have heard him tell multiple times; how investing in anything else leaves you vulnerable to arbitrary seizure and that BTC is immune to this.
While this is a nice idea, it’s also not true. There are multiple ways governments could seize BTC if they wished.
First, they could make owning BTC illegal and punishable by prison time. Most people, Saylor included, would have to hand their BTC over to the state or face the consequences. While one could hypothetically resist, it’s unlikely that most would do so. After all, BTC is no good if one doesn’t have the liberty to spend it. If most complied, which they would, the price of BTC would crash quickly, and there’d be no way to spend or cash out the coins the hold-outs cling to.
Second, they could ban exchanges and fiat on/off ramps and blacklist certain wallets. We saw this in action recently in Ottawa during the trucker protests. While the Canadian government was not able to physically seize the coins in those wallets, they were able to render them effectively useless with a few pen strokes. Since BTC is too slow and expensive to use as money, these fiat exchanges are essential for those who approach BTC as an investment asset.
Third, and going back to the point about Dr. Wright’s ongoing lawsuits, powerful enough governments can simply use the legal system to confiscate Bitcoin. Saylor told you there are tens of thousands of nodes on the Bitcoin network, but this is also false, and if governments compel miners to move coins from one wallet to their own by legal order, it can be done. The reasons for this will become apparent when I address the many nodes myth below.
Lastly, even if BTC was unconfiscatable, this would be a wholly undesirable state of affairs. Imagine a world where Pablo Escobar or the Taliban could build wealth in BTC, move it and use it for their purposes with no restrictions, and wouldn’t even have to bother hiding or launder it because there’s nothing any sovereign government could do about it anyway.
3. Bitcoin is not encrypted
Thankfully, people like Escobar or the Taliban will never be able to use Bitcoin for their purposes because it’s not “encrypted money,” as Saylor likes to call it.
Bitcoin is not encrypted at all. It literally presents in clear text and the entire history of every transaction since the Genesis block is visible on the Bitcoin ledger. That’s how it was designed to be, and at no time did Satoshi refer to Bitcoin as “encrypted money.”
That’s simply because Bitcoin is not encrypted. There’s little need to elaborate on this point as it’s self-evidently a false assertion.
The myth of thousands of Bitcoin nodes
Supporting Saylor’s fallacious argument about Bitcoin’s unconfiscatable nature is the premise that there are tens of thousands of nodes securing the network and keeping records of the ledger.
While it’s true that there are tens of thousands of ‘listening nodes’ that keep a record of the BTC ledger, it’s not true that these nodes do anything more than that. Truthfully, these are not nodes at all, and they might as well not even be there.
How do we know what a node is and is not? All we have to do is refer to the Bitcoin white paper again. In section five, Satoshi makes it clear that nodes are involved in collecting new transactions into blocks, finding a difficult proof-of-work for blocks, broadcasting blocks to other nodes, and working on creating the next block in the chain.
Source: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
Listening nodes do not solve proof-of-work, and they do not work on creating blocks at all. Therefore, by the very definition of the Bitcoin white paper published by its inventor, these “tens of thousands of nodes” are not nodes at all.
Once again, who are we going to believe about Bitcoin, Michael Saylor or Satoshi Nakamoto? The fact that most of these nodes are not nodes is precisely why Bitcoin will prove to be confiscatable by legal order. Nobody needs to know who runs these listening nodes or concern themselves with them in any way. All a government needs to do is send a legal order to miners, the real nodes on the Bitcoin network. Since miners are legal entities with a profit motive and often tens of millions invested in their operations, they will almost all comply.
Saylor’s 100-year timeframe and Bitcoin mining economics
One of Saylor’s key BTC selling points is that even gold hasn’t stood the test of time in most cases and that virtually every fiat currency has collapsed on a 100-year timeframe. He believes that BTC has been a safe investment for at least a century. Yet, it is clear that he hasn’t thought out the ramifications of how simply holding BTC and stashing it away would impact Bitcoin miners and the economics of the system.
How so? Satoshi designed the Bitcoin block subsidy to halve every 210,000 blocks precisely because he designed it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and he expected transaction fees to replace the block subsidy over time. Of course, for this to work, it requires big blocks full of millions of transactions (the kind you find in BSV) and not piddly 1MB blocks capable of seven or so transactions per second.
The Bitcoin transaction fees inside blocks are the incentive for miners to keep mining as the block reward diminishes over time. If you have the opportunity to speak with Saylor again, ask him why miners will bother lending their massive hash power, at a considerable cost, to the BTC network for an ever-diminishing block reward. If everybody views BTC as digital property and simply holds it, locking it away in digital vaults, what will pay the miners to keep pushing hash power to the network? In a couple of decades, the block subsidy won’t be worth much at all. The problem becomes blatantly obvious with few transaction fees because of the HODL mentality.
Saylor incorrectly says that “that’s why Bitcoin Satoshi Vision collapses” in reference to his winner take all thesis. In fact, mining economics explains perfectly why BTC will collapse. For a more in-depth look at Bitcoin mining economics and BSV’s inevitable victory, I suggest reading Zemes G’s essay on the subject.
The Bitcoin protocol has not changed—a jaw—dropping moment in your Michael Saylor interview
Perhaps the most startling falsehood Saylor came out with during your interview is that the BTC protocol has never changed. This is either deliberate deception or astounding ignorance about the history of Bitcoin.
Is Saylor not aware of SegWit and how it fundamentally altered the nature of Bitcoin by stripping the digital signatures out of transactions? If this is not a fundamental protocol change, I don’t know what would qualify as one. And it’s by no means the only one, either.
The truth is that BSV is the only version of Bitcoin that remains true to the original. Again, all one has to do is read the Bitcoin white paper, compare the various Bitcoin forks, and draw the necessary conclusions about which ones changed. Bitcoin is not a trading ticker (BTC). It is a protocol. It doesn’t matter that when BTC forked off, it kept the original ticker. It does matter that Bitcoin SV retains all the original capabilities of Satoshi’s Bitcoin and remains the same protocol he released in 2009.
This assertion alone should call Saylor’s credibility into question. Someone so unaware of Bitcoin’s history can not possibly make accurate predictions about its future.
Saylor is reckless and in way over his head
The only conclusion that can be reasonably drawn from your extensive and excellent interview with Michael Saylor is that he is either being deliberately deceptive or that he has failed to grasp even the basics of Bitcoin.
It’s quite frankly frightening that this man has transferred the entire treasury of a multi-billion dollar public company into BTC while holding such badly mistaken beliefs about it. Not only this, but he has repeatedly encouraged others to mortgage their homes, borrow money, and acquire BTC by any means necessary.
Patrick Bet-David, I hope this article has given you food for thought if you should ever have the opportunity to interview Michael Saylor again. While he turned down your offer to debate Peter Schiff on your show, perhaps he might accept a debate against Dr. Craig Wright or Kurt Wuckert Jr. about what Bitcoin is and how it works.
Thank you for always being willing to hear all sides of every story and continue your excellent work on the PBD Podcast!

Volpicelli,Matt Reynolds,Alex Bornyakov,Tom Simonite",www.wired.com,War Is Calling Crypto’s ‘Neutrality’ Into Question,War in Ukraine and Western sanctions against Russia have made cryptocurrency a hot potato for international politics.,https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-russia-ukraine-sanctions/,"Whose side is cryptocurrency on? If you had asked Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person (or persons) who created the Bitcoin platform in 2008, he/they likely would have rejected the question. The whole point of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin was neutrality—the fact that no government, bank, or entity could prevent you from using it, whether you were paying for a pizza, a forbidden book, or a bag of cocaine.
That, of course, started changing as soon as crypto’s value made it the perfect medium for criminal transactions, from ransomware to dark net marketplaces. Regulators around the world demanded that exchanges and other “off-ramps” blacklist cryptocurrency from accounts linked to criminal activities or individuals, despite illicit trades accounting for just 0.15 percent of global crypto movements in 2021.
But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a different matter. Crypto’s nature as borderless money, and the abundance of youngish, passionate people sitting on troves of crypto-millions made it a go-to method for Ukraine to raise funds from people outraged by Moscow’s actions. At the same time there were fears that government officials and Russian president Vladimir Putin’s moneyed inner circle might side-step western sanctions by moving their assets into crypto.
Cryptocurrency exchanges are reportedly blocking all transactions from accounts known to be linked to sanctioned individuals.
Crypto exchange Coinbase on Monday blocked over 25,000 Russia-linked addresses that it believes were linked to illicit activity to comply with sanctions against Russia. WIRED understands that Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, has already identified and blocked at least one wallet linked to a sanctioned person, and has adopted a proactive approach, investigating and blocking accounts of people who are known to be close to individuals targeted by sanctions. Exchanges in most Western countries are required to carry out know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering checks, although some of them, including Binance, have been criticized for alleged laxity.
Yet Tigran Gambaryan, Binance’s vice president of global intelligence and investigations, thinks the concerns that crypto will help to prop up Russia are overblown. “Crypto is not a very efficient way for a government and for a nation-state to elude sanctions,” he says. “There are other ways to move billions of dollars using the financial system that already exist, rather than use cryptocurrency.”
That is because moving large sums of money in cryptocurrency would hardly be covert. As soon as the owners attempted to convert it to fiat currency outside of Russia, they would alert exchanges and investigators. Obfuscation techniques such as “tumblers”—wallets that receive cryptocurrency from various accounts and scramble them to conceal provenance—are not designed for moving large sums and tend to be slow, Gambaryan says. In addition, all cryptocurrency transactions take place on a public ledger, called the blockchain, creating a permanent record that would be undesirable for organizations eager to hide their tracks.
It is still possible that some illicit trades are happening under the radar, After all, exchanges and cryptocurrency compliance firms do not necessarily know about all the wallets controlled by proxies of an individual on a sanction list. “Historically we have seen the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) name specific crypto wallets relating to sanctioned entities,” says Caroline Malcolm, head of international public policy and research at cryptocurrency forensics firm Chainalysis. “We haven't seen any of that yet. We are keeping an eye on whether OFAC, or other sanction entities in the EU and the UK, go on to name specific wallet addresses. It's obviously not something that can be done overnight. They might be missing a lot of them.”
What crypto compliance firms do know is that right now cryptocurrency trading is skyrocketing in popularity both in sanction-stricken Russia and war-torn Ukraine. According to figures by cryptocurrency analytics firm Kaiko, cited by Bloomberg, as of February 28, the amounts of bitcoin traded using the Russian ruble had surged to the highest point since May 2021, while trading volumes for the Ukrainian ​​hryvnia had reached the highest point since October. Kaiko reported a similar pattern of frantic trade between the two currencies and Tether, a “stablecoin” whose value is said to be pegged to the US dollar."

A proposal that would have effectively banned the mining and transactions of energy-intensive cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin in the European Union failed to win approval by a parliamentary committee, as the bloc pushes ahead with regulation of the fast-growing sector.
The EU’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee voted on a final draft of the Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) legislation on Monday, which included a clause pledging to make cryptoassets traded or issued within the bloc “subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards.” A final tally of the committee’s voting showed the proposed clause was defeated with 23 votes in favor, 30 against and six abstentions.
Crypto industry pundits said the proposal would have acted as a de-facto ban on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, which operate using a “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism and require large amounts of energy to mint tokens and record transactions. The proposal had promised to allow time for such tokens to improve their carbon footprint in order to comply with the new rules, though. A previous version of MiCA had suggested banning proof-of-work tokens outright.
Ernest Urtasun, shadow rapporteur on the MiCA legislation and a member of the European Parliament within the Greens/EFA political group, said the proposal wasn’t intended to force a ban on “proof of work” tokens like Bitcoin. “It was not as simple as this. Our proposal was more complex and more taking into account the need of the industry to adapt,” he said.
The committee passed a separate proposal to add cryptocurrency mining to the EU’s taxonomy for sustainable finance, which would define whether crypto can be viewed as a sustainable investment. MiCA now needs to be approved by the EU’s executive arm, as well as EU member states and the full European Parliament before it can become law. Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies traded flat following the outcome of the vote.
Crypto’s energy consumption is a hotly debated topic. Industry supporters say its impact on the environment can be limited by encouraging miners to use renewable energy sources, but demand for Bitcoin and other tokens has pushed up their carbon footprint significantly in the last year. Data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance put Bitcoin’s estimated power consumption at an annual rate of 138 terawatt-hours in early 2022, more than the size of a country like Norway.
“Bitcoin won that vote,” said Michael Saylor, chief executive of software company MicroStrategy, during a webinar hosted by the Economic Club of New York on Monday. “You need energy to create real property.”
Markus Ferber, a lawmaker and the EPP Group’s spokesman in the committee, said the failed proposal sent a “clear signal” that the EU wishes to support the crypto industry as it grows.
“Banning ‘proof of work’ would have meant for the EU to become crypto no man’s land,” Ferber said. “If we want to foster innovation, we should be open for new technologies, not banning them.”

Backers of Bitcoin feared the rules, which came up for a key committee vote, would make it impossible for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency to operate in the EU.
At issue was an amendment in the EU’s bill for markets in crypto assets (MiCA), pushed by the Greens and S&D, that would ultimately phase the so-called Proof-of-Work (PoW) system out of the bloc — unless operating on a small scale.
The initiative comes amid widespread concerns among regulators and environmentalists that the energy needed to power the computers that run PoW will undermine the EU’s battle against climate change. Plugging these computers into renewables, meanwhile, could also push up energy prices.
Left-leaning MEPs had hoped to avoid this by phasing carbon-intensive blockchains out of the growing market. But the other side of the aisle argued the initiative would run hurt innovation and only push the crypto market into other jurisdictions — rather than dealing with the problem.
A total of 30 MEPs rejected the phase-out measure, according to a voting register obtained by POLITICO, while 23 lawmakers voted in favor. Six abstained from the vote in the Parliament’s committee on economic and monetary affairs (ECON).
A majority of MEPs instead supported a separate initiative that would require the European Commission to include more environmentally friendly blockchain technologies to the EU taxonomy — a list that informs investors of what the EU considers green.
Negotiations with EU governments in the Council can now begin after Stefan Berger, the conservative German MEP shepherding the bill through Parliament, also received enough backing within ECON to begin so-called trilogue talks without going to plenary.
“By adopting my amendment to the MiCA report, the EU Parliament has paved the way for innovation-friendly crypto regulation that can set standards worldwide,” Berger wrote in a text message.
Shifting crypto on into taxonomy debate, meanwhile, will ensure the debate on PoW’s high energy-usage is guaranteed — without banning Bitcoin, according to Berger.
But the Greens and S&D have accused the taxonomy compromise of being too soft and take issue with the fact that Berger had originally agreed to the phase-out plan before changing tact.
“We are disappointed that the rapporteur did not keep his word, breached previous broadly accepted agreements and gave up, given external pressures, to defend the interests of a part of the crypto industry,” Green MEP Ernest Urtasun said in an emailed statement.
“With the energy crisis the EU is experiencing and the negative prospects, we simply cannot turn a blind eye,” the Spaniard continued, comparing Bitcoin’s entire carbon footprint to that of Greece. “We will continue to push for this issue to be addressed, either during the negotiations with the Council in the trilogue stage or with the creation of new ad hoc rules.”

The European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee voted on Monday on the proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, the EU’s legislation for governing digital assets.
A last-minute addition to the bill was made over the weekend, which aimed to limit the use of cryptos that are powered by the energy-intensive process called proof-of-work (PoW). But it was voted down by the parliamentary committee on Monday.
Crypto-assets are neither issued nor guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority and are therefore currently out of the scope of EU legislation. The European Parliament argues this can cause ""risks for consumer protection and financial stability"" and could lead to market manipulation and financial crime.
There is also widespread concern over the sustainability of cryptocurrencies as the energy consumption of Bitcoin equals that of entire small countries, according to some studies.
What did the EU vote for?
MEPs voted for a uniform legal framework for crypto-assets in the European Union. This includes, measures for consumer protection and safeguards against market manipulation and financial crime.
To reduce the cryptos' carbon footprint, MEPs have asked the European Commission to include crypto-assets mining in the EU taxonomy (a classification system) for sustainable activities by 2025.
The draft rules had 31 votes in favour to 4 and 23 abstentions. Formal negotiations on the draft framwork will now proceed between the European commission, council and parliament.
""With the adoption of the MiCA report, the European Parliament has paved the way for an innovation-friendly crypto-regulation that can set standards worldwide,"" said MEP Stefan Berger of the European People's Party.
What is PoW and how bad is it for the environment?
Bitcoin and Ethereum use PoW, the mechanism used to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the chain.
All of the participants in the PoW blockchain network compete simultaneously to solve a cryptographic algorithm. The algorithm is designed to become more difficult to solve the more computers there are trying to solve it, which means a huge amount of computational power and therefore energy is expended validating each block in a blockchain.
Many countries such as China have banned crypto mining due to its massive energy consumption, as the country battled power cuts last year.
Despite the crackdown in China, which was the top destination for crypto miners, a recent study showed Bitcoin mining actually got much dirtier and emits around the same amount of CO2 annually as a country the size of Greece.
Several EU parliamentarians have been pushing to ban PoW cryptos in favour of more sustainable energy. However, they have also raised concerns that switching to renewable energy would mean such energy is favoured for crypto mining rather than for public use.
Another option could be to move to the Proof-of-Stake model, which is considered greener as it randomly allocates coins to users, who put up coins for collateral.
The draft proposal on limiting PoW received backlash from the cryptocurrency community.
“Individuals and organisations should be free to choose the technology most appropriate to their needs,” a statement from the crypto wallet provider Ledger read.
“Policymakers should neither impose nor discriminate in favour of a particular technology. This is deeply concerning and would have serious consequences for Europe”."

March 15 (Reuters) - Bitcoin loves flirting with the mainstream. But now, as the U.S. president says he wants to get serious, it may be getting cold crypto feet.
When Joe Biden ordered officials to prepare reports on the role of cryptocurrencies in future finance last Wednesday, bitcoin leapt as much as 9% and ether 8%, as many crypto fans hailed a potential milestone in mainstream acceptance.
""The real importance of it is that the president of the United States is talking about crypto,"" said Jack McDonald, CEO of Standard Custody, a firm handling digital asset custody solutions for institutional investors.

Yet cryptocurrencies are complicated.
While bitcoin danced above $42,500 following the news, it has since given up those gains and is now back at around $38,000. Similarly ether has slunk back down to straddle $2,500.
That seems a muted market reaction to the White House's first formal pronouncement on crypto - though who can truly understand bitcoin, still licking its wounds from China's rejection and nursing nagging disquiet it's losing its identity.
Regulation can be a double-edged sword.
Some industry watchers see bullish signs for bitcoin, saying the presidential announcement could presage U.S. regulations on crypto that will draw far more institutional money from the likes of pension funds and insurance firms.
""Biden's executive order could signal the end to the wild west of crypto as we know it,"" said Edmund Kulakowski, senior financial crime consultant at London-based regulatory software company Fenergo.
Yet it may not be such good news for those crypto players that thrive in the wild.
""Quant-driven hedge funds running arbitrage and quant strategies typically shine in more volatile and unstructured markets,"" said Ganesh Iyer, chief marketing and strategy officer at New York-based technology company IPC.
""Only time will tell how and when this market will mature. Until that point there is an opportunity now for hedge funds to utilize ultra-low latency networks to make the most of volatile, compliance-light and liquid crypto markets.""
WHO'S THE SHERIFF?
There's also little certainty over America's regulatory intentions, with Biden having given federal agencies six months to produce guidance on how best to proceed.
For one thing, it's not clear who's going to be the crypto sheriff, or for that matter whether crypto should be treated as a security or commodity.
Both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees listed stocks and therefore tokens that are deemed to be securities, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which has oversight of commodity and derivatives markets, are among those required to give their input into the reports.
""Specifics related to the SEC, CFTC and other financial regulators are light,"" said Jerald David, president of Arca Labs, the innovation arm of Los Angeles-based digital asset manager Arca.
Shane Rodgers, a former investment banker and CEO of PDX Coin, a crypto-to-fiat payments app and utility coin, said he was waiting to see how the regulation might shape up, particularly in terms of defining the role of the SEC.
Until there is more visibility, he added, ""the government can forget innovation in the crypto space in the U.S. because I, for one, will not be hiring any people or spending large amounts of R&D money in this country"".
AMERICA'S CRYPTO POWER
What seems certain, regardless of how this plays out, is that U.S. action will have a major impact on the global crypto industry.
America, the epicentre of traditional finance, is fast becoming the same for crypto; 43% of the world's crypto hedge fund managers are now based there, according to PwC, while the United States is now also the centre for bitcoin mining after China's crackdown on that part of the industry last year.
McDonald at Standard Custody described Biden's order as a ""symbolic document"".
""He did not come out and say it's fraud or bad actors doing bad things,"" he added. ""Quite the contrary, there is an admission that digital assets have a place in the future, that this industry requires a thoughtful approach to regulation.""

""Large outflows like this one are actually part of a consistent trend in the Coinbase balance, which has been stair-stepping downwards over the last two years,"" Glassnode said in a weekly newsletter published Monday. ""As the largest exchange by BTC balance, and a preferred venue for U.S. based institutions, this further supports the adoption of bitcoin as a macro asset by larger institutions.""
The past week's outflow has pushed the number of coins held on the Nasdaq-listed exchange to a four-year low of 649,500 BTC. The balance held across all centralized exchanges has dropped to 2,519,403 BTC, the lowest number since November 2018.
The declining exchange balance means fewer coins are available for liquidations on the exchange. In other words, the sell-side liquidity is drying up, suggesting scope for a sharp move on the higher side, especially as the coins withdrawn from Coinbase were moved to a largely inactive wallet.
""If we look at the Illiquid Supply Shock Ratio (ISSR), we can see a significant uptick this week, suggesting that these withdrawn coins have been moved into a wallet with little-to-no history of spending,"" Glassnode said."

Room for another Bitcoin drop?
Woo assessed the average price at which short-term investors entered the Bitcoin market across history and charted the daily change in the value. That resulted in a cost basis, a metric that signals when ""inexperienced"" traders sell BTC to ""experienced"" traders during a BTC free fall, which typically coincides with the market bottom.
The cost basis underwent significant dips during the previous bear markets, also before strong accumulation took place, as shown in the chart below. Interestingly, Bitcoin's ongoing correction — from $69,000 in November 2021 to around $39,000 in March 2022 — has not resulted in a massive drop in its cost basis.

""It’s inconclusive whether we have capitulated yet,"" said Woo, adding that ""there’s room for another drop"" based on the cost basis signal.
Whales have been selling their BTC
Woo's outlook appeared in line with the rising speculations about Bitcoin's next big drop. For instance, Christopher Yates, the editor at AcheronInsights, said BTC's price could crash to $30,000 due to the ""deteriorating macro environment.""
""What makes me increasingly wary that the low is not yet in for 2022 is the fact that we are yet to see a capitulation style spike in volume that has occurred at all the recent lows in late 2019, early 2020 and mid-2021,"" Yates wrote in his latest BTC analysis, adding:
""Though not a prerequisite for a market bottom, such a capitulation-like spike in volume helps to give us confidence for when such a bottom may be near.""
Data resource Ecoinometrics provided evidence of the demand gap between small and rich Bitcoin investors in its latest weekly report. For example, it noted that addresses that hold as much as 10 BTC have been accumulating the coins in the past 30 days.

Conversely, those that hold more than 10 BTC have been distributing them.
Woo also noted that Bitcoin whales have been selling off their stash, thus maintaining the downward pressure on price. That means small investors have been absorbing the sell-side pressure, and so far preventing Bitcoin price from dipping below $30,000.
Additionally, Ecoinometrics analyst Nick, noted that the ongoing accumulation trend is ""as sluggish as it gets,"" adding that it could grow weaker after the Federal Reserve's expected rate hike in March to tame rising inflation. Excerpts:
""To summarize, the Fed is in control. If they mess up their tightening cycle, all risk assets will tank. Bitcoin currently trades like a risk asset, so it is unlikely to be an exception.""
Ecoinometrics and Willy Woo's analysis also show that inexperienced investors have not been dumping their coins, thus becoming long-term holders (LTH) in the process.
Bitcoin is ""most deflationary"" in history
Meanwhile, another metric dubbed ""LTH Inflation/Deflation ratio"" is also corroborating the aforementioned theory, according to ARK Invest on-chain analyst David Puell.
In detail, Bitcoin inflation points to LTH releasing their BTC into circulation faster than the natural sell-side of miners. Conversely, deflation suggests that LTHs have absorbed a proportional amount of the miner sell-side every day alongside the outstanding total supply.

Ethereum has added nearly 6%, meanwhile, as the wider market starts to recover.
Last week was pretty much flat for the wider cryptocurrency market, but the top coins are beginning to mount a recovery today, with Bitcoin and Ethereum posting notable gains.
Bitcoin topped the $41,000 mark twice over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko, and currently sits at a price of $40,791—a nearly 5% increase over the past 24 hours. It’s the first time in nearly a week that Bitcoin has risen above $41,000.
Granted, the leading cryptocurrency is still down significantly over the last three months. It was sitting above $50,000 in late December, but the wider crypto market has suffered in the span since, with Bitcoin itself dropping as low as about $33,500 in January.
On Tuesday, prior to the latest price action, OANDA Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote that Bitcoin “remains trapped in a tight range despite improving sentiment for risk,” reflecting the lack of significant movement in recent days. Since then, however, Bitcoin is showing some upward movement. Moya pegged Bitcoin’s current ceiling at $45,000.
Noted on-chain Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo tweeted today that the coin was demonstrating “little green shoots forming after a winter.”

Ethereum is up nearly 6% over the last day, meanwhile, at a current price of $2,706. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and leading smart contract platform is now at its highest price in about a week, but hasn’t touched the $3,000 mark since March 2.
Rival smart contract platform Solana is showing a 5% gain over the past 24 hours, as of this writing, at a current price above $84, while Polkadot is up nearly 6% to $18. According to CoinGecko, the overall market is up about 4% over the past 24 hours.
Not every crypto coin in the top 10 by market cap has seen such sizable gains today, however: XRP is up less than 2% at a current price of $0.77, for example, while Binance Coin and Cardano are each up about 3% as of this writing.
Looking at the wider top 100 coins, The Sandbox’s SAND token is one of the biggest winners today, climbing some 11% overnight. The Ethereum-based metaverse game just announced partnerships with celebrity Paris Hilton and Europe’s second-largest bank, HSBC.
Fantom’s FTM token also gained about 11% over the past 24 hours after a turbulent couple weeks for the DeFi-centric ecosystem. Developer Andre Cronje said on March 6 that he was quitting the DeFi space (again), which sent tokens from his projects—chiefly FYM and Yearn Finance’s YFI—plummeting.
FTM is still down nearly 10% over the past seven days, but jumped over the last day, possibly in part due to being listed on the eToro trading platform for the first time."
184,2022-03-16,2022-03-16,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Joseph Hall,cointelegraph.com,‘We don’t like our money’: The story of the CFA and Bitcoin in Africa,Bitcoin and crypto experts from central and West Africa speak out on Bitcoin and crypto adoption.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-don-t-like-our-money-the-story-of-the-cfa-and-bitcoin-in-africa,"Nearly 150 million people use the franc of the Financial Community of Africa (CFA) on a daily basis, from Senegal in the extreme west to Gabon in the center of the continent.
Used in 14 countries, the CFA franc is pegged to the euro, printed in France and its monetary policy is controlled by Western powers. As Fodé Diop, a Bitcoin (BTC) Lightning developer hailing from Senegal details, “The IMF and the French government still control the currency.”
While the official peg to the euro is 1 euro to 655.96 CFA francs, its purchasing power has eroded over time. In 1994, the World Bank devalued the CFA franc against the French franc from 1:50 to 1:100. That year, West Africans woke up to realize the value of their life savings had been slashed in half.
Gloire, the founder of Kiveclair, a Bitcoin Beach-inspired refugee project in the Congo, told Cointelegraph that the CFA “makes whole countries dependent,” and “It is usually the poorest who suffer.” He explained the situation in 1994:
“The most striking example is that of 1994 when France and a privileged few decided to devalue the CFA Franc. There is no guarantee that such a thing will not happen again, especially since the global economy is threatened.”
Prior to the creation of Bitcoin, West Africans could store their money in euros, U.S. dollars or traditional stores of value: real estate and commodities. For everyday people, however, those options are not readily available.
Mama Bitcoin, the first retailer to accept cryptocurrency in Senegal, told Cointelegraph that the CFA is “disempowering.” She suggests that Bitcoin could provide a way out.
“Our money belongs to France, the CFA is made in France and is — for want of a better word, colonial money. Bitcoin, however, Bitcoin belongs to everyone.”
With the arrival of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, indeed, there is now a viable alternative. Gloire suggests that “Bitcoin can help the countries of the CFA Zone to free themselves from France to finally turn the dark page of colonization.”
In Senegal, Mouhammad Dieng, co-founder of SenBlock, a nonprofit organization for crypto promotion and adoption, told Cointelegraph that he doesn’t “like the CFA, because its monetary policy does not allow us to develop. Bitcoin is a less risky alternative to make the transition to an African digital currency.”
Interestingly enough, the hope to replace the CFA is not restricted to grassroots cryptocurrency advocates. Governments of West African countries have been vocal in their efforts to improve the CFA and develop some autonomy.
With the current monetary policy, CFA zone countries are obliged to send more money to France than other countries due to colonial ties — there is zero sovereignty over the currency.
A new currency called the ECO was flouted as a replacement for the CFA. However, it would still be pegged to the euro and biased to France. Concerning digital currencies — which Dieng mentions — the e-Naira, the digital version of neighboring Nigeria’s currency, has influenced the view of the CFA governments with regard to digital currencies and CBDCs. However, an e-ECO or e-CFA has not yet been planned.
Notwithstanding, the opportunity for a stronger currency in the CFA African territories is vast. The GDP of the CFA region is roughly $170 billion and covers 14 independent countries. It’s a huge region with tremendous untapped resources, particularly agriculture and minerals.
Pape Alioune, a software engineer who founded Shintsha, a cryptocurrency exchange that allows payments via mobile money, told Cointelegraph: “‘What country can develop without its own money or, better yet, a neutral money?”
The Senegalese–South African team behind Shintsha — which will soon rebrand to Mole App — has created an innovative way of addressing the low banking levels in Africa. The exchange hopes to onboard more and more Africans into Bitcoin and crypto through mobile money, an Africa-centric solution.
Mobile money, originally derived from a Kenyan invention called M-Pesa, allows sim cardholders to pay each other with credit. It is incredibly popular in Subsaharan Africa, from Senegal to Somalia to Malawi. Orange money is one of the most popular outlets, although Free Mobile and Wave also exist.

Alioune estimates that “more than 80% of the adult population uses mobile money in Senegal, and it’s similar in other countries that use the CFA.” Africans use the tech the same way Northern Europeans use contactless payments — it’s become a reflex, part of the daily routine.
While there is a sense of optimism in West Africa with regards to the future of cryptocurrency and more routes to purchasing crypto, “Education remains the most significant hurdle to overcome.” That’s according to Nourou, the founder of Bitcoin Senegal who is on a mission to facilitate Bitcoin adoption in his home country.
For Nourou, given that literacy rates in his home nation are just 50%, he speaks with business owners, entrepreneurs and educated members of the community. “Most people in West Africa have at least heard of Bitcoin. It’s a question of getting through to the right people and spreading awareness,” he told Cointelegraph.
Nourou agrees with Gloire in that it’s not just about Bitcoin, it’s “absolutely necessary to educate people about money.” Gloire adds that while learning about money is key, people must “understand that it is possible to decide one‘s destiny without asking permission.”
He brings up the example of smartphones which are “penetrating Africa at a good pace,” to illustrate that Africa can pick up new technologies and run with them. As much as 46% of the Subsaharan population in Africa has a smartphone and, as evidenced, mobile money is booming.
“The biggest challenge is to teach young people that a simple telephone and an internet connection are effective weapons to protect themselves from the CFA by adopting Bitcoin.”
For Idrissa Seck, a Bitcoin enthusiast and bank payment agent, understanding money is the key to unlocking an understanding of Bitcoin. “In order to understand and ultimately fall in love with Bitcoin, you have to understand money and the current financial system,” he told Cointelegraph.

Dieng repeats, “education, education, education,” adding that you must spend “at least 50 hours learning before investing in crypto.”
With regard to the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the CFA zone, Gloire takes inspiration from the “Salvadorian experience,” which is “going quite well.” The first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador’s hotly awaited Bitcoin bonds are imminent. For Gloire:
“Several other countries could certainly include Bitcoin among the means of raising funds without going through institutions with rarely positive interests for the abundance of populations.”
Africa has all the ingredients to make meaningful use of cryptocurrencies, according to Mama Bitcoin. It’s on a path to greater freedoms. It comes back to the notion that “Bitcoin belongs to everyone.”
Nourou of Bitcoin Senegal sums up Bitcoin and Africa’s relationship best. When asked if the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakomoto could be an African, he replies:
“What do you mean? Satoshi is African.”"

The The global crypto volume also rose over the past day. The total volume of traded coins amounted to $94.32 billion over the course of the last day. This has jumped by 1.06 per cent over the last 24 hours.
“The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018, from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent to combat the surging inflation rate. In most cases, the rise of interest rates tends to signal uncertainty for the crypto market as investors have greater access to yield from low-risk avenues of the market,” said the CoinDCX Research Team on the crypto market movement.
“Yet, in contrast, the past 24 hours have witnessed the crypto market responding atypically, trending further upwards to continue its bullish trend in the greens,” it said.
This could be a case of a lag in market reaction and investors may only begin to witness its true impact on crypto down the line, it added.
Bitcoin price today stood at $40,894.44 as per data. This was up by 0.82 per cent in the last 24 hours. Ethereum or Ether, the second most popular cryptocurrency in the global market, also rose by 4.25 per cent in the last 24 hours to stand at $2,797.39, according to data by CoinMarketCap.
“The bitcoin prices remained fairly neutral and unfazed at $40K as the US Federal Reserve hiked the Interest rate by 25 basis points.

The next resistance for BTC is expected at $44,500 level
“Alongwith Bitcoin, Ethereum too was largely unaffected due to the recent interest rate hike by the Feds. Ethereum prices maintained its position above the $2,700 level,” it added.

Like the mining industry, the cryptocurrency mining industry has serious environmental ramifications as a result of the energy-intensive process through which coins are created. But unlike the mining industry, the cryptocurrency industry may start changing the way it operates.
Here's what you need to know about why cryptocurrency mining is unsustainable and the new developments that might change that.
What's the environmental impact of cryptocurrency?
To understand the environmental impacts of cryptocurrency, we must first understand how new coins in a cryptocurrency are created. Because cryptocurrencies aren't regulated by a central authority, the blockchain relies on users to validate transactions and update the blockchain with new blocks of information. To protect against bad actors attempting to manipulate this new information, these blockchains need to be very difficult and costly to verify. Thus proof of work was implemented into most cryptocurrencies.
Proof of work is a consensus mechanism that allows users to validate cryptocurrency transactions by solving a complicated mathematical problem. The first person that solves the puzzle validates the transaction and is awarded a fixed amount of cryptocurrency. Then the cycle starts again. It's the most widely used consensus mechanism.
When someone ""mines"" cryptocurrency, they're actually running programs on their computer that are trying to crack the problem. The greater the power behind your computer, the greater chance you have of winning the right to update the blockchain and reap the rewards. So miners are incentivized to put more power behind their mining operations to beat their competition.
Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, very powerful computers designed with the sole purpose of mining a particular cryptocurrency algorithm, were created to further optimize computing power towards solving these proof-of-work problems. Though ASIC miners can be used to mine any cryptocurrency, they are now essential for mining Bitcoin since the competition is so tough.
""Every time more people mine more Bitcoin, the competition rises,"" says Junior Theomou, the founder of Miners DeFi, a Bitcoin mining company that operates on hydropower electricity. ""The more machines on the market, the more difficult it becomes to mine Bitcoin. So now you have a competition going on, with more and more machines, mining and competing within each other.""
The University of Cambridge estimates that Bitcoin alone generates 132.48 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually, which easily surpasses the annual energy usage of Norway at 123 TWh in 2020. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by this energy usage will vary depending on how that energy was created. But in 2020, the US — where 35.4% of Bitcoin mining takes place since China banned cryptocurrency mining in 2021 — created .85 pounds of carbon dioxide per kWh. This results in nearly 40 billion pounds of carbon dioxide produced by US Bitcoin mining alone.
Additionally, every four years or so, the amount of Bitcoin that is distributed for solving the puzzle and updating the blockchain is cut in half. The last halving took place in 2020, when the reward was cut from 12.5 coins to 6.25. After each halving, the carbon emissions required to create one coin is doubled overnight.
Are all cryptocurrencies bad for the environment?
Proof of work is the predominant method of validation, and will most likely remain relevant for the time being. However, not all cryptocurrencies are created through proof of work and so they don't require the processing power or energy to mine as a coin from proof of work.
Blockchains still need to be validated, but recent validation methods have emerged that provide comparable levels of security through alternate methods of verification.
Proof of stake: In this validation mechanism, miners use the cryptocurrency they already own to gain access to mining rights proportional to the coins they already own. They lock their coins away to create a validator node, which can verify a transaction. When a block of new information needs to be approved, the blockchain chooses a random validator node. If the validator verifies the block, they can add it to the blockchain. If they try to add a block of inaccurate information, they lose some of the coins they put at stake.
Though this system doesn't have the energy usage issues that plague proof of work, it has been criticized for systemic inequities, as the people with the most coins get the most returns. It's worth noting that it is also expensive to purchase the computing power needed to mine through proof of work. There are already more than 200 coins that operate through proof of stake , the largest of which is Solana, with a market cap of $28.39 billion.
Proof of burn: Proof of burn is a mix of both proof of work and proof of stake. Under proof of burn mechanisms, validators burn an amount of cryptocurrency — which means those coins are permanently removed from circulation. In doing this, validators buy a virtual mining rig which works proportionally to the amount of coins you burn — the more you burn the faster you mine. This then allows you to mine cryptocurrency without the enormous energy expenditures.
This is a relatively new mechanism that was created specifically to address the environmental concerns around proof of work mining. As such, it hasn't caught on in any significant way. Slimcoin is the only cryptocurrency that uses this mechanism so far.
Note: Though you can burn the coins of the blockchain you plan to mine, some blockchains allow you to burn coins from other blockchains.
Proof of capacity: Instead of measuring computational power or stake, proof of capacity uses available storage space on a mining device's hard drive for validation. Possible solutions to the proof of capacity mining algorithm are stored using whatever empty space is available on a mining device, so the more storage capacity you have, the more solutions you can store, which means there's a greater chance that you have the correct solution to the algorithm.
A handful of coins use this system including Burst, Chia, and Storj.
Proof of elapsed time: Proof of elapsed time is another consensus mechanism, though it is primarily used in permissioned blockchains, which are blockchains that require access to view as opposed to public blockchains. This uses a lottery style to determine who goes to update the blockchain, so it's fairly random.
The future of crypto and the environment
Despite advancements in alternative sources for generating cryptocurrency, proof of work mining doesn't show any signs of slowing down. In January of 2020, Bitcoin's monthly consumption was an estimated 6.07 TWh, which rose to 8.92 TWh in January of 2021. As of January 2022, usage was at 10.95 TWh.
For proof of work mining, the question becomes finding a sustainable way to supply the electricity needed for the computing power that these miners use. This means moving mining operations out of the US and towards countries with more ways to generate green energy. ""When [mining] got banned in China, people moved all the way to the US,"" Theomou says. ""So it's concentrated. We need to have Bitcoin mining going on in many places in the world.""
However, sections of the cryptocurrency industry are moving away from proof of work out of concern for the environment. Ethereum, the second most traded cryptocurrency on the market, is working to move away from proof of work and towards proof of stake.
Note: Proof of stake is also the foundation upon which Web3 will be built.
On individual levels, there have also been efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The Crypto Climate Accords have garnered 250 signatures from individuals and companies. These signatories are committing themselves to reducing their carbon emissions to net-zero by 2030 and eventually decarbonizing the entire cryptocurrency industry by 2040.
Yet Theomou says that the cryptocurrency industry will never completely shift its focus away from Bitcoin because it's highly unlikely that Bitcoin will undergo any drastic changes. ""It's only as secure as it is because it hasn't changed ever. And that is what people love about it, just knowing that this is how it is, and this is how it will always be,"" he says.
Theomou says that cryptocurrency education is the most important aspect to sustainable cryptocurrencies. Because Bitcoin is the most widely known coin, it is often where people get started.
""The more people learn about crypto, they learn about all the options, and they can easily decide not to use one crypto and therefore use another which is more environmentally friendly, and doesn't use proof of work,"" he says. ""The options are there, but you need to get educated to even see the wider options, and use them."""

In a tweet on March 17, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, released a fresh bullish take on Bitcoin’s (BTC) future under the current macro conditions.
Gold beating Bitcoin is “unlikely” this year
Well known for his belief in Bitcoin coming from the latest global financial turmoil out on top, McGlone argued that inflation would ultimately help Bitcoin’s “maturation” as an asset class, claiming it would even beat gold in terms of returns.
“Facing the Federal Reserve, inflation and war, 2022 may be primed for risk-asset reversion and mark another milestone in Bitcoin’s maturation,” he wrote.
“It's unlikely for Bitcoin to stop outperforming gold, stock market amid bumps in the road as the Fed attempts another rate-hike cycle.”
An accompanying chart showed Bitcoin’s performance relative to a basket of macro assets.

The forecast followed the first in what the Fed hinted would be a series of key interest rate hikes, an event that delivered a modest but welcome boost to BTC price action.
Former BitMEX CEO sees $1 million BTC
McGlone, however, was far from alone in his prediction. Arthur Hayes, former CEO of derivatives exchange BitMEX, delivered a stark warning about what was to come for global financial markets in his latest Medium post.

The Ukraine–Russia war, while adding to inflationary pressure, is symbolic because it has shown that even a central bank’s foreign currency assets can be effectively stolen, he argued.
“You cannot remove the world’s largest energy producer — and the collateral these commodity resources represent — from the financial system without serious unimagined and unintended consequences,” he reasoned.
Covering a range of macro topics, the post foresaw a restructuring of the financial system, during which Bitcoin, like stocks and commodities, would see heavy losses.
“If you aren’t willing to babysit your Bitcoin, then close your eyes, press that buy button, and concentrate on the safety of your family from a physical and monetary perspective. Awakening a few years after the fog of war dissipates will present a situation where hard money instruments rule all of global trade,” Hayes wrote.
Ultimately, however, both Bitcoin and gold should take a significantly more important role as stores of value in the face of declining participation in the U.S. dollar and euro standard from other governments.
Under such circumstances, which he acknowledged were to play out “over the next decade,” gold could be five figures an ounce, while a single Bitcoin could fetch a seven-digit dollar sum.
“For a single Bitcoin, my unit is in the millions. For an ounce of gold, my unit is in the thousands,” he continued.
“That is the magnitude of fiat denominated price that will occur in the coming years as global trade is settled via neutral hard monetary instruments and not the debt-backed fiat currencies of the West.”"

We’re here to clear things up.,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/cryptocurrency-crypto-guide.html,"Crypto is a lot of things – including terribly explained. We’re here to clear things up.
Until fairly recently, if you lived anywhere other than San Francisco, it was possible to go days or even weeks without hearing about cryptocurrency.
Now, suddenly, it’s inescapable. Look one way, and there are Matt Damon and Larry David doing ads for crypto start-ups. Swivel your head — oh, hey, it’s the mayors of Miami and New York City, arguing over who loves Bitcoin more. Two N.B.A. arenas are now named after crypto companies, and it seems as if every corporate marketing team in America has jumped on the NFT — or nonfungible token — bandwagon. (Can I interest you in one of Pepsi’s new “Mic Drop” genesis NFTs? Or maybe something from Applebee’s “Metaverse Meals” NFT collection, inspired by the restaurant chain’s “iconic” menu items?)
Crypto! For years, it seemed like the kind of fleeting tech trend most people could safely ignore, like hoverboards or Google Glass. But its power, both economic and cultural, has become too big to overlook. Twenty percent of American adults, and 36 percent of millennials, own cryptocurrency, according to a recent Morning Consult survey. Coinbase, the crypto trading app, has landed on top of the App Store’s top charts at least twice in the past year. Today, the crypto market is valued at around $1.75 trillion — roughly the size of Google. And in Silicon Valley, engineers and executives are bolting from cushy jobs in droves to join the crypto gold rush.
As it’s gone mainstream, crypto has inspired an unusually polarized discourse. Its biggest fans think it’s saving the world, while its biggest skeptics are convinced it’s all a scam — an environment-killing speculative bubble orchestrated by grifters and sold to greedy dupes, which will probably crash the economy when it bursts.
I’ve been writing about crypto for nearly a decade, a period in which my own views have whipsawed between extreme skepticism and cautious optimism. These days, I usually describe myself as a crypto moderate, although I admit that may be a cop-out.
I agree with the skeptics that much of the crypto market consists of overvalued, overhyped and possibly fraudulent assets, and I am unmoved by the most utopian sentiments shared by pro-crypto zealots (such as the claim by Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter chief, that Bitcoin will usher in world peace).
But as I’ve experimented more with crypto — including accidentally selling an NFT for more than $500,000 in a charity auction last year — I’ve come to accept that it isn’t all a cynical money-grab, and that there are things of actual substance being built. I’ve also learned, in my career as a tech journalist, that when so much money, energy and talent flows toward a new thing, it’s generally a good idea to pay attention, regardless of your views on the thing itself.
My strongest-held belief about crypto, though, is that it is terribly explained.
Recently, I spent several months reading everything I could about crypto. But I found that most beginner’s guides took the form of boring podcasts, thinly researched YouTube videos and blog posts written by hopelessly biased investors. Many anti-crypto takes, on the other hand, were undercut by inaccuracies and outdated arguments, such as the assertion that crypto is good for criminals, notwithstanding the growing evidence that crypto’s traceable ledgers make it a poor fit for illicit activity.
What I couldn’t find was a sober, dispassionate explanation of what crypto actually is — how it works, who it’s for, what’s at stake, where the battle lines are drawn — along with answers to some of the most common questions it raises.
This guide — a mega-F.A.Q., really — is an attempt to fix that. In it, I’ll explain the basic concepts as clearly as I can, doing my best to answer the questions a curious but open-minded skeptic might pose.
Crypto boosters will likely quibble with my explanations, while dug-in opponents may find them too generous. That’s OK. My goal is not to convince you that crypto is good or bad, that it should be outlawed or celebrated, or that investing in it will make you rich or bankrupt you. It is simply to demystify things a bit. And if you want to go deeper, each section has a list of reading suggestions at the end.
Crypto will be transformative
Understanding crypto now — especially if you’re naturally skeptical — is important for a few reasons.
The first is that crypto wealth and ideology is going to be a transformative force in our society in the coming years.
You’ve heard about the overnight Dogecoin millionaires and Lamborghini-driving Bitcoin bros. But that’s not the half of it. The crypto boom has generated vast new fortunes at a clip we’ve never seen before — the closest comparison is probably the discovery of oil in the Middle East — and has turned its biggest winners into some of the richest people in the world, essentially overnight. Some riches could vanish if the market crashes, but enough has already been cashed out to ensure that crypto’s influence will linger for decades.
Crypto’s madcap, meme-crazed online culture can make it seem frivolous and shallow. It’s not. Cryptocurrencies, even the jokey ones, are part of a robust, well-funded ideological movement that has serious implications for our political and economic future. Bitcoin, which emerged out of the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis, first caught on among libertarians and anti-establishment activists who saw it as the cornerstone of a new, incorruptible monetary system. Since then, other crypto realms have fashioned similarly lofty goals, like building a decentralized, largely unregulated version of Wall Street on the blockchain.
We are already starting to see a swell of crypto money headed toward the U.S. political system. Crypto entrepreneurs are donating millions of dollars to candidates and causes, and lobbying firms have fanned out across the country to win support for pro-crypto legislation. In the coming years, crypto moguls will bankroll the campaigns of crypto-friendly candidates, or run for office themselves. Some will peddle influence in the familiar ways — forming super PACs, funding think tanks, etc. — while others will try to escape partisan gridlock altogether. (Crypto millionaires are already buying up land in the South Pacific to build their own blockchain utopias.)
Crypto is poised to soon become one of a handful of true wedge issues, with politicians all over the world forced to pick a side. Some countries, like El Salvador — whose crypto-loving president, Nayib Bukele, recently announced the development of a “Bitcoin City” at the base of a volcano — will go full crypto. Other governments may decide that crypto is a threat to their sovereignty and crack down, as China did when it outlawed cryptocurrency trading last year. The divide between the world’s pro-crypto and no-crypto zones could end up being at least as big as the divide between the Chinese internet and the American one, and maybe even more consequential.
In America, we have already seen how crypto can scramble the usual partisan allegiances. Former President Donald J. Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, are united in crypto skepticism, for example, while Senator Ted Cruz, Republican from Texas, is in the same bullish camp as Senator Ron Wyden, the Democrat from Oregon. We have also seen what can happen when the crypto community feels politically threatened, as happened last summer, when crypto groups rallied to oppose a crypto-related provision in President Biden’s infrastructure bill.
What I’m saying, I guess, is that despite the goofy veneer, crypto is not just another weird internet phenomenon. It’s an organized technological movement, armed with powerful tools and hordes of wealthy true believers, whose goal is nothing less than a total economic and political revolution.
Crypto could be destructive
The second reason to pay attention to crypto is that understanding it now is the best way to ensure it doesn’t become a destructive force later.
In the early 2010s, the most common knock on social media apps like Facebook and Twitter was that they just wouldn’t work as businesses. Pundits predicted that users would eventually tire of their friends’ vacation photos, that advertisers would flee and that the whole social media industry would collapse. The theory wasn’t so much that social media was dangerous or bad; just that it was boring and corny, a hype-driven fad that would disappear as quickly as it had arrived.
What nobody was asking back then — at least not loudly — were questions like: What if social media is actually insanely successful? What kind of regulations would need to exist in a world where Facebook and Twitter were the dominant communication platforms? How should tech companies with billions of users weigh the trade-offs between free speech and safety? What product features could prevent online hate and misinformation from cascading into offline violence?
By the middle of the decade, when it was clear that these were urgent questions, it was too late. The platform mechanics and ad-based business models were already baked in, and skeptics — who might have steered these apps in a better direction, if they’d taken them more seriously from the start — were stuck trying to contain the damage.
Are we making the same mistake with crypto today? It’s possible. No one knows yet whether crypto will or won’t “work,” in the grandest sense. (Anyone who claims they do is selling something.) But there is real money and energy in it, and many tech veterans I’ve spoken to tell me that today’s crypto scene feels, to them, like 2010 all over again — with tech disrupting money this time, instead of media.
If they’re wrong, they’re wrong. But if they’re right — even partly — the best time to start paying attention is now, before the paths are set and the problems are intractable.
The third reason to study up on crypto is that it can be genuinely fun to learn about.
Sure, a lot of it is dumb, shady or self-refuting. But if you can look past the carnival barkers and parse the convoluted jargon, you’ll find a bottomless well of weird, interesting and thought-provoking projects. The crypto agenda is so huge and multidisciplinary — drawing together elements of economics, engineering, philosophy, law, art, energy policy and more — that it offers lots of footholds for beginners. Want to discuss the influence of Austrian economics in Bitcoin development? There’s probably a Discord server for that. Want to join a DAO that invests in NFTs, or play a video game that pays you in crypto tokens for winning? Dive right in.
Crypto is a generational skeleton key
Mind you, I am not suggesting that the crypto world is diverse, in the demographic sense. Surveys have suggested that high-earning white men make up a large share of crypto owners, and libertarians with dog-eared copies of “Atlas Shrugged” are likely overrepresented among crypto millionaires. But it’s not an intellectual monolith. There are right-wing Bitcoin maximalists who believe that crypto will liberate them from government tyranny; left-wing Ethereum fans who want to overthrow the big banks; and speculators with no ideological attachments who just want to turn a profit and get out. These communities fight with one another constantly, and many have wildly different ideas about what crypto should be. It makes for fascinating study, especially with a bit of emotional distance.
And if you do learn some crypto basics, you might find that a whole world opens up to you. You’ll understand why Jimmy Fallon and Steph Curry are changing their Twitter avatars to cartoon apes, and why Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, spent a decent chunk of last year tweeting about a digital currency named after a dog. Strange words and phrases you encounter on the internet — rug pulls, flippenings, “gm” — will become familiar, and eventually, headlines like “NFT Collector Sells People’s Fursonas for $100K In Right-Click Mindset War” won’t make you wonder if you’re losing your grip on reality.
Crypto can also be a kind of generational skeleton key — maybe the single fastest way to freshen your cultural awareness and decipher the beliefs and actions of today’s young people. And just as knowing a little about New Age mysticism and psychedelics would help someone trying to make sense of youth culture in the 1960s, knowing some crypto basics can help someone perplexed by emerging attitudes about money and power feel more grounded.
Again, I don’t really care whether you emerge from these explainers as a true believer, a devoted skeptic or something in between. Participate or abstain as you wish! All I’m after is understanding — and possibly, a little relief from the question that has consumed my social and professional life for the past several years:
“So … can I ask you a question about crypto?”
Let’s start from the beginning: What is crypto?
A decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography. But in recent years, it’s been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies. These days, “crypto” usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains — the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like Bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like NFTs, web3 applications and DeFi trading protocols.
Ah yes, blockchains. Can you remind me, without going into too much technical detail, what they are?
At a very basic level, blockchains are shared databases that store and verify information in a cryptographically secure way.
You can think of a blockchain like a Google spreadsheet, except that instead of being hosted on Google’s servers, blockchains are maintained by a network of computers all over the world. These computers (sometimes called miners or validators) are responsible for storing their own copies of the database, adding and verifying new entries, and securing the database against hackers.
So blockchains are … fancy Google spreadsheets?
Sort of! But there are at least three important conceptual differences.
First, a blockchain is decentralized. It doesn’t need a company like Google overseeing it. All of that work is done by the computers on the network, using what’s called a consensus mechanism — basically, a complicated algorithm that allows them to agree on what’s in a database without the need for a neutral referee. This makes blockchains more secure than traditional record-keeping systems, proponents believe, since no single person or company can take down the blockchain or alter its contents, and anyone trying to hack or change the records in the ledger would need to break into many computers simultaneously.
The second major feature of blockchains is that they’re typically public and open source, meaning that unlike a Google spreadsheet, anyone can inspect a public blockchain’s code or see a record of any transaction. (There are private blockchains, but they’re less important than the public ones.)
Third, blockchains are typically append-only and permanent, meaning that unlike with a Google spreadsheet, data that’s added to a blockchain typically can’t be deleted or changed after the fact.
Got it. So blockchains are public, permanent databases that nobody owns?
You’re getting it!
Now remind me: How are blockchains related to cryptocurrencies?
Blockchains didn’t really exist until 2009, when a pseudonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto released the technical documentation for Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin used a blockchain to keep track of transactions. That was notable because, for the first time, it allowed people to send and receive money over the internet without needing to involve a central authority, such as a bank or an app like PayPal or Venmo.
Many blockchains still perform cryptocurrency transactions, and there are now roughly 10,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, according to CoinMarketCap. But many blockchains can be used to store other kinds of information, too — including NFTs, bits of self-executing code known as smart contracts and full-fledged apps — without the need for a central authority.
OK, but can we back up a second? Weren’t tech people telling us, years ago, that crypto was a new and exciting form of money? And yet, nobody I know pays their rent or buys groceries in Bitcoin. So were those people just … wrong?
Good question. It’s true that today, hardly anyone pays for things in cryptocurrency. In part, that’s because most merchants still don’t accept crypto payments, and hefty transaction fees can make it impractical to spend small amounts of cryptocurrency on daily living expenses. It’s also because the value of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether has historically gone up, making it somewhat risky to use them for offline purchases. (The counterexamples are usually cited with pity, like the guy who, in 2010, bought two Papa John’s pizzas using Bitcoin that was worth about $40 at the time, but would be worth roughly $400 million today.)
It’s also true that the value of cryptocurrencies has grown enormously since the early Bitcoin days, despite them not being most people’s daily spending money.
Part of that growth is speculation — people buying crypto assets in hopes of selling them for more later on. Part of it is because the blockchains that have emerged since Bitcoin, like Ethereum and Solana, have expanded what can be done with this technology.
And some crypto fans believe that the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will eventually stabilize, which could make them more useful as a means of payment.
What are the actual uses of crypto, beyond financial speculation?
Right now, many of the successful applications for crypto technology are in finance or finance-adjacent fields. For example, people are using crypto to send cross-border remittances to family members abroad and Wall Street banks using blockchains to settle foreign transactions.
The crypto boom has also led to an explosion of experiments outside of financial services. There are crypto social clubs, crypto video games, crypto restaurants and even crypto-powered wireless networks.
These non-financial uses are still fairly limited. But crypto fans often make the case that the technology is still young, and that it took the internet decades to mature into what it is today. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into crypto start-ups because they think that someday, blockchains will be used for all kinds of things: storing medical records, tracking streaming music rights, even hosting new social media platforms. And the crypto ecosystem is attracting tons of developers — an auspicious sign for any new technology.
I’ve heard people calling crypto a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme. What do they mean?
Some critics believe that cryptocurrency markets are fundamentally fraudulent, either because early investors get rich at the expense of late investors (a pyramid scheme), or because crypto projects lure in unsuspecting investors with promises of safe returns, then collapse once new money stops coming in (a Ponzi scheme).
There are certainly plenty of examples of pyramid and Ponzi schemes within crypto. They include OneCoin, a fraudulent crypto operation that stole $4 billion from investors from 2014 to 2019; and Virgil Sigma Fund, a $90 million crypto hedge fund run by a 24-year-old investor who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.
But these cases aren’t usually what critics are talking about. They’re generally arguing that crypto itself is an exploitative scheme, with no real-world value.
And are they right?
Well, let’s try to understand the case they’re making.
Unlike buying stock in, say, Apple, a purchase that (theoretically, at least) reflects a belief that Apple’s underlying business is healthy, buying a cryptocurrency is more like betting on the success of an idea, they say. If people believe in Bitcoin, they buy, and Bitcoin prices go up. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, they sell, and Bitcoin prices go down.
Crypto owners, then, have a rational incentive to convince other people to buy. And if you don’t think that cryptocurrency technology is inherently valuable, you might conclude that the entire thing resembles a pyramid scheme, in which you primarily make money by recruiting others to join.
I’m sensing a “but” coming on.
But! Even though there are scams and frauds within crypto, and crypto investors are certainly fond of trying to recruit other people to buy in, many investors will tell you that they are going in with their eyes wide open.
They believe that crypto technology is inherently valuable, and that the ability to store information and value on a decentralized blockchain will be attractive to all kinds of people and businesses in the future. They would tell you they’re betting on crypto the product, not crypto the idea — which, on some level, isn’t all that different from buying Apple stock because you think the next iPhone is going to be popular.
Matt Huang, a prominent investor, spoke for many crypto fans when he said on Twitter: “Crypto may look like a speculative casino from the outside. But that distracts many from the deeper truth: the casino is a trojan horse with a new financial system hidden inside.”
You can argue with that position, or dispute how much this “new financial system” is actually worth. But crypto investors clearly believe it’s worth something.
Is crypto regulated?
Only slightly. In the United States, certain centralized crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, are required to register as money transmitters and follow laws like the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires them to collect certain information about their customers. Some countries have passed more stringent regulations, and others, like China, have banned cryptocurrency trading entirely.
But compared with the traditional financial system, crypto is very lightly regulated. There are few rules governing crypto assets like “stablecoins” — coins whose value is pegged to government-backed currencies — or even clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service about how certain crypto investments should be taxed. And certain areas of crypto, like DeFi (decentralized finance), are almost completely unregulated.
Partly, that’s because it’s still early, and making new rules takes time. But it’s also a property of blockchain technology itself, much of which was designed to be hard for governments to control.
This question comes from the (apparently crypto-curious) rapper Cardi B: Is crypto going to replace the dollar?
Sorry, Cardi. The dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and dislodging it would be a huge, costly project that isn’t likely to happen any time soon. (To give just one small example of the enormity of the task: every financial contract that is denominated in dollars would have to be re-denominated in Bitcoin or Ether or some other cryptocurrency.)
There are also technical hurdles crypto needs to overcome if it’s ever going to displace government-issued currency. Today, the most popular blockchains — Bitcoin and Ethereum — are slow and inefficient compared with traditional payment networks. (The Ethereum blockchain, for example, can process only about 15 transactions per second, whereas Visa says it can process thousands of credit card transactions per second.)
And, of course, for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin to replace the dollar, you’d need to convince billions of people to use a currency whose value fluctuates wildly, that isn’t backed by a government and that often can’t be retrieved if it’s stolen.
What kind of people are investing in crypto? Is it all — to quote a recent “Curb Your Enthusiasm” episode — “nerds and Nazis”?
It’s hard to say who’s investing in crypto, especially since a lot of activity takes place anonymously or under pseudonyms. But some surveys and studies have suggested that crypto is still dominated by affluent white men.
Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange, estimated in a recent report that women made up only 26 percent of crypto investors. The average crypto owner, the group found, was a 38-year-old man making approximately $111,000 a year.
But crypto ownership does appear to be diversifying. A 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that Asian, Black and Latino adults were more likely to have used crypto than white adults. Crypto adoption is also growing outside the United States, and some studies have suggested that crypto adoption is growing fastest in countries like Vietnam, India and Pakistan.
My colleague, Tressie McMillan Cottom, has made the case that crypto — because it relies on permanent, irrefutable records of ownership of digital goods and currencies — is particularly attractive to people from marginalized groups, who may have had their property unjustly taken from them in the past.
“If I live in a community where the police absolutely use eminent domain to claim my private property and I cannot do anything about it,” she wrote, “that sense of everyday powerlessness would make the promise of blockchain sound pretty good.”
That said, some recent studies have also found that a small number of people own the vast majority of crypto wealth — so it’s not necessarily an egalitarian paradise.
And what about extremists? Are they into crypto?
Some are. Because you can buy and sell cryptocurrency without using your name or having a bank account, crypto in its early days was a natural fit for people who had reasons to avoid the traditional financial system. They included criminals, tax evaders and people buying and selling illicit goods. They also included political dissidents and extremists, some of whom had been kicked off more mainstream payment services like PayPal and Patreon.
As a result of their well-timed entry into the crypto market, some extremists have gotten rich. A recent investigation by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that several prominent white supremacists have made hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars by investing in crypto.
Of course, there are millions of crypto owners, the vast majority of whom are not white supremacists. And the same properties of anonymity and censorship-resistance that make crypto useful to white supremacists might also make it attractive to, say, Afghan citizens fleeing the Taliban. So labeling the entire crypto movement an extremist group would be overkill. Regardless, it’s safe to say that crypto has become attractive to all kinds of people who would rather not deal (or can’t legally deal) with a traditional bank.
Another criticism I’ve heard is that crypto is bad for the environment. Is that true?
This is a real can of worms — and one of the most frequent objections to crypto.
Let’s start with what we know for sure. It’s true that most crypto activity today takes place on blockchains that require large amounts of energy to store and verify transactions. These networks use a “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism — a process that has been compared to a global guessing game, played by computers all competing to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to add new information to the database and earn a reward in return. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computers, which in turn use lots of energy.
The Bitcoin blockchain, for example, uses an estimated 200 terawatt-hours of energy per year, according to Digiconomist, a website that tracks crypto energy usage. That’s comparable to the annual energy consumption of Thailand. And Bitcoin’s associated carbon emissions have been estimated at roughly 100 megatons per year, which is comparable to the carbon footprint of the Czech Republic.
Holy moly! How do crypto fans justify that kind of environmental impact?
Crypto advocates often quibble with these statistics. They also argue that:
• Our existing financial system also uses a lot of energy, between powering millions of bank branches, A.T.M.s that sit idle for most of the day, gold mines and other energy-intensive infrastructure.
• Many crypto-mining computers are already powered by renewable energy sources, or by energy that would otherwise be wasted.
• Most newer blockchains are built using consensus mechanisms that require much less energy than proof-of-work. (Ethereum, for example, is scheduled to switch to a new type of consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake sometime in 2022, which could reduce its energy usage by as much as 99.5 percent.)
And are those arguments valid?
Partly. It’s true that most newer blockchains are designed in a way that requires considerably less energy than Bitcoin, and that Ethereum’s switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism will greatly shrink its environmental footprint, if and when it happens.
But it’s also a bit convenient to steer attention away from Bitcoin, which is still the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin’s energy needs aren’t expected to fall significantly anytime soon. And even if every Bitcoin miner ran entirely on renewable energy — which, to be clear, isn’t the case — there would still be an environmental cost associated with maintaining the blockchain.
All told, it’s clear that crypto as we know it today has a significant environmental impact, but it’s hard to measure exactly how significant. Many frequently cited statistics come from industry groups, and it’s hard to find trustworthy, independent data and analysis.
But few crypto fans would dispute that blockchains consume substantially more energy than a traditional, centralized database would — just as 100 refrigerators use more energy than one refrigerator. They just argue that crypto’s environmental impact will shrink over time, and that the benefits of decentralization are worth the costs.
Got it. And those benefits, again, are …
Some crypto proponents will tell you that the biggest benefit of decentralization is the ability to create currencies, apps and virtual economies that are resistant to censorship and top-down control. (Imagine a version of Facebook, they’ll say, in which Mark Zuckerberg couldn’t unilaterally decide to kick people off.)
Others will say that the biggest perk of decentralization is that it allows artists and creators to control their own economic destinies more directly by giving them a way (in the form of NFTs and other crypto assets) to bypass platform gatekeepers like YouTube and Spotify, and sell unique digital works directly to their fans.
Still others will say that crypto is most useful to people who don’t live in countries with stable currencies, or to dissident groups living under authoritarian regimes.
There are a million other hypothetical benefits of decentralization and crypto, some of which are realistic and some of which probably aren’t.
How do you actually use crypto? Is it like sending a payment over Paypal or Venmo?
It can be. The quickest way to get started using cryptocurrencies is to set up an account with a crypto exchange like Coinbase, which can link to your bank account and convert your U.S. dollars (or other government-issued currency) into cryptocurrency.
But many crypto users prefer setting up their own “wallets” — secure places to store the cryptographic keys that unlock their digital assets.
Once you’ve got some crypto in your wallet, the process can be pretty simple — just type in the recipient’s crypto wallet address, pay a transaction fee (if applicable), and wait for the payment to clear.
Other types of crypto transactions, like buying and selling NFTs, can be significantly more complicated, but the basic act of sending a payment to someone typically takes only a few minutes.
I’m ready to dive into the rest of your explainers. But first, I have one final question about crypto’s culture: Why is it so weird and insular?
This is maybe the question I get asked most about crypto. People see their friends, co-workers and relatives diving down the crypto rabbit hole and emerging days or weeks later with a new obsession, new internet friends, a bunch of new jargon and the seeming inability to talk about anything else. (There’s even a word for this — getting “cryptopilled.”) People who believe in crypto tend to really believe in it — to the point that they can appear to the outside world more like evangelists for a new religion than fans of a new technology.
I was a religion reporter once, and I don’t think the comparison is totally inapt. (It’s also not necessarily a bad thing: Plenty of people find meaning and community and intellectual stimulation in religion.) As people like the Bloomberg journalist Joe Weisenthal have pointed out, crypto has similar elements to an emerging religion: an enigmatic founder (the still-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto), sacred texts (the Bitcoin white paper) and rituals and rites to mark yourself as a believer, such as tweeting “gm” (crypto speak for “good morning”) to your fellow believers, or photoshopping laser eyes onto your profile picture.
It’s fun to laugh at the (often cringeworthy) ways crypto fans try to entertain and inspire each other. But focusing too much on their behavior and customs might mean missing what’s genuinely novel — and, depending on where you sit, either exciting or dangerous — about the technology itself. Which is why, when my friends ask me how to talk to their cryptopilled relatives, I advise them to start by trying to understand what’s gotten them so excited in the first place.

A report by Arcane Research indicates that publicly listed Bitcoin miners are “constantly looking for expansion opportunities,” as they “plan to increase hashrate faster than the whole network in 2022.”
Publicly listed Bitcoin miners projected hashrates. Source: Arcane Research
44.95% of the global hash rate derives from North American miners, according to the latest figures from the Cambridge Bitcoin electricity consumption index. With the massive projected increases in target hash rate among the publicly traded Bitcoin miners, it‘s “likely to increase.”
Jaran Mellerud, an analyst for Arcane Research, told Cointelegraph that “most publicly listed miners pursue a hodl strategy, doing their best to keep as much they can of their mined Bitcoin.”
“This hodl strategy enables them to serve as Bitcoin investment vehicles for investors who want to own bitcoin indirectly through an investment structure.”
Whit Gibbs, the founder and CEO of Compass Mining, explained to Cointelegraph that “public mining companies definitely have an advantage when it comes to hodling Bitcoin because they have access to the capital markets.”
“They don‘t need to liquidate their Bitcoin in order to buy more machines, increase their rack space, etc. They‘re able to go to the capital markets and get that money to continue to expand. So, they‘re able to hold large positions in Bitcoin.”
Some of the largest miners hold huge amounts of Bitcoin, Gibbs adds, ”it‘s crazy how much some of them are holding.” As published on BitcoinTreasuries, Bitcoin mining company Marathon hold the third-largest amount of Bitcoin among businesses worldwide, right behind Tesla and MicroStrategy.

Since January 2021, miners’ reserves have been steadily increasing, reflective of their HODL strategy. Gibbs suggests that the publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies are “taking more of a bullish approach to Bitcoin.”
“The companies are looking at Bitcoin on their balance sheet as a way to drive up their market valuations.”
Miners' reserves in blue are steadily increasing. Source: CryptoQuant
Mellerud also understands that Bitcoin mining stocks are increasingly popular in legacy financial markets. “The demand for Bitcoin investment vehicles is high, particularly in the U.S. since the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market is immature.” The Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) saga is an Achilles heel to the network, as successive Bitcoin ETF applications have been rejected.

While market interest for Bitcoin miners swells, Mellerud sums up why the mining business model is attractive and effective, echoing Gibbs‘ comments:
“Miners are some of the biggest Bitcoin bulls out there, and they utilize the highly developed equity and debt markets in the U.S. to raise money to pay for their expansions and operating expenses, allowing them to keep the Bitcoin they mine.”
Bitcoin Miner Hut 8, for example, recently posted record revenues, with its overall BTC holdings surging by 100%. 2022 may not be the year of the bull, but it‘s certainly a good time to publicly mine the orange coin."

If the reverse is the case (that is, if there is a drop in the number of miners competing to find new blocks), the protocol reduces the mining difficulty to make it easier for the remaining miners to discover blocs.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not centralized bodies or physical products. It is not easy to just expect an increase.
What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a digital asset. It is described as a cryptocurrency because it was created to exchange it the same way we use money.
All their transactions are internet-based and recorded in a blockchain. The blockchain records the transaction history for each unit.
The blockchain is important because it proves ownership of every unit.
Bitcoin is a virtual token, and the tokens can be programmed to record financial transactions and other crucial information.
Crypto transactions are similar to the monetary system. However, the crypto feature is the most lucrative feature.
The system allows to sending of cryptocurrencies between parties in exchanges for goods and services.
There are many stores, including AMC movie theatres, where you can pay with Bitcoin.
Cryptos are not controlled by authorities, Bitcoin has plenty of advantages. Nevertheless, there's a spike in crimes committed with Bitcoin and against its users like scams.
Cryptos are inflation-resistant, transparent, but used mainly in dark markets.
Who controls Bitcoin price?
The value of Bitcoin is set by the market forces that have an influence on the value of their goods and services.
The supply of Bitcoins depends on how many new coins are mined and how many owners want to sell their coins.
The demand for Bitcoin depends on the increase of its value, in the monetary system (if it works well), if more businesses accept it, and if smart contracts become more common.
Nevertheless, ""value is relative to the investor. If bitcoin meets your investing goals, risk tolerance and gives you the returns you want at a price you're willing to pay,"" as The Guide of Bitcoin said."

Ethereum rallied on Saturday, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency moved closer to the $3,000 level. The global crypto market cap was over 4% higher as of writing, with bitcoin climbing by nearly 3.5%.
Bitcoin
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed above $42,000 for the first time in ten days to start the weekend, as cryptocurrencies rallied, following a week of volatility.
Crypto prices were traded with high levels of uncertainty following the Fed rate hike, however, as markets seem to have finally moved past this news, bitcoin bulls once again reappeared.
As of writing this, BTC/USD rose to a high of $42,195.74 to commence the weekend, following an intraday low of $40,402.06 less than 24-hours ago.
Today’s surge has seen the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue), moving averages cross, however, the direction of the crossover remains in doubt, due to recent price uncertainty.
Looking at the chart, bitcoin now hovers below its long-term resistance level of $42,080, which is a point that has not been successfully broken since February 28.
In addition to this ceiling, the 14-day RSI also tracks at a resistance level of 55.4, if both hurdles are passed, many could be targeting a $45,000 point for BTC.
Ethereum
Ethereum (ETH) rose to its highest level in over two weeks on Saturday, as prices climbed for a sixth consecutive session.
Last week saw ethereum trade predominantly near its support of $2,550, however, since the turn of the week, markets had consistently moved away from this point.
On Saturday, ETH/USD came within a stone’s throw away from the 3K mark, as prices hit a peak of $2,973.62.
With the RSI indicator continuing to move past obstacles, and now tracking at a six-week high, the expectation is that we will see ETH at $3,000 before the end of today’s action.
This could however be a bull trap set by bears, as history has also shown several market reversals that occur at this point.
Will ethereum continue to climb once it moves past $3,000? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

""Coinbase is what we would call one of the bubble stocks,"" Chanos, the founder of Kynikos Associates, told CNBC in an interview, revealing he's now shorting Coinbase—meaning he's betting the price of Coinbase stock will fall.
""We think that as competition increases in crypto, and this is not a call on crypto or bitcoin prices or anything like that, but we think as competition increases amongst the exchanges, you're going to see fee compression, and as it is Coinbase will probably not be profitable this year with a $40 billion market cap.""
Coinbase, which made its closely-watched Nasdaq debut in April last year, has seen its value plunge by almost half, falling sharply along with the bitcoin price.
""We're seeing the economics starting to diverge,"" said Chanos, referring to Coinbase stock's link to the bitcoin price and somewhat pouring cold water on expectations the exchange will be able to diversify its earnings with expansion into the non-fungible token (NFT) market that has seen huge growth over the last year.
This week, Needham equity research analyst John Todaro said Coinbase could see an additional $1.2 billion in revenue via the NFT market. Late last year, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said the exchange's still-to-launch NFT trading service had a waiting list of 1 million users, recently adding the NFT market remained strong despite trading volumes falling sharply.
""There are plenty of companies that are in the new economy that have real growth, real cash flows with real earnings, but there's a lot that are just being sold on stories. And we would argue that Coinbase is one that's being sold on a story,"" Chanos added.

Cryptocurrencies have taken on an unprecedented role in the war in Ukraine, helping the government raise millions of dollars to fund its fight against the Russian invasion.
Why has Ukraine turned to cryptocurrencies, and how is the nascent crypto industry changing its reputation and having an effect amid the clouds of war?
How much crypto has been raised?
At the outset of the conflict, Ukrainian officials posted addresses for two crypto wallets on their Twitter account, giving donors a direct and clear address to which to send contributions.
The wallets attracted more than $10.2m (9.2 million euros) just four days after the start of the invasion.
Since then, more than $100m worth of crypto has been raised, with the “Crypto Fund for Ukraine” run by Michael Chobanian – the founder of the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna – accounting for 60 percent of all donations.
“We are still collecting crypto. It is being spent on aid like daily rations and bullet-proof vests and helmets,” the 37-year-old Ukrainian told AFP.
Initially, two funds were set up, one for humanitarian purposes and the other to support the Ukrainian military.
However, after the violence escalated across Ukraine, the funds were merged and focused fully on supporting the military, said Chobanian.
He said that the majority of crypto donations came in the form of Bitcoin, Ethereum and the stablecoin Tether – a coin pegged one-to-one to the dollar.
What are the benefits of donating in crypto?
Aid packages sent to Ukraine in fiat money from the United States and the European Union dwarf cryptocurrency donations, but the latter allow individuals to get involved.
US crypto charity, The Giving Block, told AFP that cryptocurrency donations have the potential to attract “younger donors” who are looking to support various causes.
Another reason crypto donations are of value to Ukraine is because they are less influenced by geopolitical or macroeconomic factors. Chobanian points to the depreciation in the value of the Ukrainian hryvnia as a result of inflation.
An extra advantage of donating in cryptocurrencies is the speed of the transfers. Bank wires may take up to 24 hours to be validated between two countries. However, cryptocurrency transfers typically take less time.
What are the drawbacks?
Despite the success of crypto in aiding the Ukrainian war effort, it has not always been a smooth ride.
In the early days of the conflict, the deputy minister for digital transformation wanted to issue Ukraine’s own crypto as a symbolic gesture for Kyiv’s cause, but the project was eventually cancelled.
To make matters worse, people seized the opportunity to mint and market fake versions of the planned government-issued crypto.
“There was a lack of communication” within the government, said Chobanian, who now works closely with the ministry.
“It was the first day of the war,” he recalls.
Moreover, cryptocurrencies have become a staple part of Ukraine’s shadow economy – used as a medium of exchange in online crime, tax avoidance and capital flight.
According to data analytics firm Chainalysis, transactions from Eastern Europe to other regions are particularly high, and the company suggests that “capital flight could account” for some of the crypto movement in the area.
What are the consequences?
Despite the risks associated with crypto, Chobanian is confident that it will become a core part of the Ukrainian economy.
“When we win the war, we will rebuild Ukraine using blockchain technology. All of us were helped by crypto,” he said.
While Chobanian’s aspirations may be very ambitious, they are based on real developments.
On Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy passed a law that would provide a legislative framework for crypto platforms and users to operate within the country.
Caroline Malcolm, head of international public policy and research at Chainalysis, told AFP that the conflict in Ukraine “is forcing governments to develop their understanding of cryptocurrencies and their regulation”.
She believes that such discussions can be beneficial to the crypto industry, leading to “proportionate and effective regulatory policies”.
As of last week, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order seeking further clarification and guidance on crypto regulation – showing Washington’s willingness to contend with an ever-growing and new asset class."

At present, 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied only on services provided by crypto exchanges and is categorised as financial services.
GST officers told the PTI news agency that cryptocurrencies are similar to casinos, gambling, betting, which have 28% of the GST on the entire value. Besides, GST at 3% is levied on the entire transaction value in the case of gold.
Another GST official said that if GST will be levied on the entire transaction of cryptocurrencies then the rate would be in the range of 0.1-1%. However, firstly the 'classification' decision will have to be finalised and then the rate will be discussed.
The GST has not clearly made a classification of cryptocurrency. In the absence of a law regulating such virtual digital currencies, the classification has to take into account whether the law classifies it as an actionable claim.
An actionable claim is a claim which can be made by a creditor, for any type of debt other than a debt secured by a mortgage of immovable property.
The 2022-23 Budget has brought in clarity with regard to the levy of income tax on crypto assets. From April 1, a 30% I-T plus cess and surcharges, will be levied on such transactions in the same manner as it treats gambling, lottery, and other speculative transactions.
The Budget 2022-23 also proposed a 1% TDS on payments towards virtual currencies beyond ₹10,000 in a year and taxation of such gifts in the hands of the recipient. The threshold limit for TDS would be ₹50,000 a year for specified persons, which includes individuals/HUFs who are required to get their accounts audited under the I-T Act.
The provisions related to 1% TDS will come into effect from July 1, 2022, while the gains will be taxed effective April 1.

We could tie such a strong outflow to the extreme fear on the market.
Net flow by position
Ethereum has faced the largest outflows on the market, with $748 million in the cryptocurrency moved from centralized exchanges. As Glassnode data suggests, the net flow for Ether remains at -164 million.
Bitcoin's net flow also remains negative, with $700 million worth of cryptocurrency leaving the market as traders move their funds away from exchanges. Previously, U.Today noted that massive outflows during the correction period may cause a supply shock in the future, when the demand for cryptocurrency recovers to 2021 levels.

The only cryptocurrency that faced a positive net flow was Ether-based Tether stablecoin with $353 million poured into the market, which may reveal two things: traders will purchase more cryptocurrencies with their Tether holdings, or the Treasury releases more coins into circulation to balance the price of the asset.
Why do traders choose to move funds away from exchanges?
While economic and market causes could affect traders' desire to move funds away from centralized entities, the limitations that exchanges faced recently from regulators caused a panic among cryptocurrency investors who kept their holdings on exchanges.
Many CEOs warned users about their inability to avoid orders from financial regulators and that they will have to ban or limit traders. Statements incentivized outflows from all major exchanges as traders started actively moving funds to cold or hot noncustodial wallets with one-sided access."

Bitcoin can only handle seven transactions per second compared to Visa’s 24,000+. But, remember, Bitcoin doesn’t use energy to validate transactions. The miners’ job is to secure the network, add new blocks of data to the chain and win bitcoin in return. That’s what they spend energy on. They’re not primarily interested in validating transactions. That consensus on the true state of the network is primarily the job of non-mining, Bitcoin full nodes. Plus, Bitcoin transactions are not the same as Visa or other payment processors’ transactions. Bitcoin transactions provide (probabilistic) finality, Visa’s don’t. Visa’s success depends on the success of separate systems. Visa’s “token” is not native to its network."

Speculation is rife. Will it rise? Will it fall? Should I invest more in Bitcoin this year? Or should I try another digital currency? All are pertinent questions, but before any decisions are made, make sure you know your subject.
10) How can regulations be placed on cryptocurrency?
Most people think that cryptocurrency is entirely unregulated, but this isn't strictly the case, at least not in many developed countries. In the United States, for example, cryptocurrency exchanges fall under the same regulatory scope of the Bank Secrecy Act - or BSA. What this means is that cryptocurrency exchange providers are obliged to be registered with the US Treasury’s Financial Crime Enforcement Network. They must have adequate anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist measures in place and they must also provide regular reports to government regulatory bodies.
An estimated 16% of Americans have investments in cryptocurrency and recently, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order that directed US federal government agencies to coordinate their efforts to regulate the digital asset and cryptocurrency market.
9) Does Bitcoin have any regulations imposed on it?
The answer to that is no. While governments can control the way exchanges operate in certain circumstances, there are no international laws imposed that can regulate Bitcoin - or other cryptocurrencies in circulation. Many countries allow Bitcoin to be used for buying and selling goods. In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to sanction the use of Bitcoin as a mainstream currency. Bitcoin is classed as a peer-to-peer currency, which means it can be used in transactions anonymously, across e-wallet account holders globally. It, therefore, has a somewhat murky reputation. But this is improving as it becomes a more acceptable form of digital currency.
8) Which country uses cryptocurrencies the most?
You'd be forgiven for thinking the answer to this question is either the US or El Salvador - where Bitcoin is considered a mainstream currency. But actually, relatively speaking, the nation with the highest level of cryptocurrency usage of all types, is Vietnam. According to Statistica, this small and in many ways undeveloped APAC country has registered an incoming cryptocurrency transaction value almost on the same level as India.
7) Which countries have banned cryptocurrency?
Data shows that even though China has banned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, an estimated 20% of the worldwide Bitcoin network is actually in China. Other countries to ban its use are Qatar, Russia, Turkey, North Macedonia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Morocco, and Iraq.
6) How long does it take to mine a single Bitcoin?
According to Investopedia, the best Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining software can currently mine a Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in just 10 minutes. A platform called BFGminor is considered one of the most effective tools for mining Bitcoin because it can run on a variety of operating systems - namely Linux, Mac, or Windows, it’s Open Source and is compatible with FPGA, ASIC, and GPU.
5) Who is the wealthiest cryptocurrency user in the world?
Earlier this year, Bloomberg released a report stating that the richest cryptocurrency and Bitcoin tycoon is Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao - a Chinese billionaire. Known in financial circles as CZ, the cryptophile who is worth an estimated US$96bn, enjoys a diamond-studded lifestyle in the UAE, owns a penthouse suite in the Burj Khalifa and is being wooed by Abu Dhabi Royals who have been keen for him to launch his exchange in the country. They got their wish recently as Binance was granted a virtual asset license by Dubai's regulator as the crypto exchange seeks to expand further in the United Arab Emirates.
4) Is Bitcoin a safe and value-accruing investment?
According to the experts, no. Although it's an unthinkable scenario now, the president and portfolio manager of the US investment firm Paulson & Co, John Paulson, predicted that at some point in the future, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency will become worthless. His words were echoed in an article in the UK’s Guardian newspaper and the BBC, by the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir Jon Cunliffe, who remarked, “Their price can vary quite considerably and [bitcoins] could theoretically or practically drop to zero.”
3) Will imposing cryptocurrency regulations restrict the market value?
Those that enjoy the renegade and wild west world of cryptocurrency, are often quick to criticise attempts by those in financial regulatory positions who recommend that cryptocurrency should be subject to stiffer regulations. But the infamous former Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, has a different take. He believes that regulating the world of peer-to-peer finance will actually result in massive growth. Belfort says that whenever a financial investment possibility is stabilised by regulation, it becomes far more attractive to big gun investors - and once that happens, the sky is the limit.
2) Will governments ever successfully impose regulations on cryptocurrency?
It's a double-edged sword. The birth of cryptocurrency was a deliberate two fingers up to the global financial establishment. It was always meant to be regulated entirely by market demand and not by interfering governments who regularly manipulate and bend currency value to meet their needs. Traditional Fiat currencies are given their worth by the issuer and are controlled by the governments that back their worth. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are therefore seen as a threat to the centralised financial control offered by the global banking system. But, as Belfort points out, without the legitimacy of regulations, cryptocurrency also remains essentially, an unstable gamble for investors.
1) Will Ethereum ever become as valuable as Bitcoin?
All reports suggest that yes, Ethereum could well become as valuable as Bitcoin, and this could happen sooner than you think. The open-source currency which was conceptualised in 2013, has been recognised by leading banking players such as Goldman Sachs as a rising star in cryptocurrency terms. The investment bank noted publicly that Etherium is likely to even surpass the $660bn ‘market capitalisation’ of Bitcoin because its network has real-world applications and as a currency, it has the ability to store value. Ethereum offers the possibility of smart contracts and programmable money - something that Bitcoin, which is now termed as a legacy currency, is not able to provide."

For followers of the first and seminal cryptocurrency, Bitcoin tattoos have been around for almost a decade while influential Bitcoiners were quick to ink themselves. Didi Taihuttu, a Bitcoin showman and father of the Bitcoin Family, was an early adopter of Bitcoin ink in 2017. His tattoo represents “freedom and no longer being part of the system.”
Anita Posch, a Bitcoin author and podcaster, has a lightning bolt tattooed on her forearm. She explained in a German language Bitcoin documentary called “Human B” that the tattoo “represents energy.” A recipient of a recent Human Rights Foundation grant distributed in Satoshis, Posch is a passionate advocate for the Lightning Network.

209,2022-03-22,2022-03-22,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Tonantzin Carmona,The Avenue",www.brookings.edu,Mayors: Cryptocurrency won’t solve your cities’ problems,,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2022/03/22/mayors-cryptocurrency-wont-solve-your-cities-problems/,"Miami Mayor Francis Suarez wants to make his city the world’s cryptocurrency capital. New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ first paycheck was automatically converted to bitcoin and ethereum. And in Jackson, Tenn., Tampa Bay, Fla., Austin, Texas, and other cities across the country, mayors are embracing cryptocurrencies.
These mayors want to strike “digital gold” for their cities and boost economic growth by attracting cryptocurrency and blockchain companies. Some even believe cryptocurrencies may be a way to address income inequality or provide alternative payment methods for unbanked and underbanked residents.
However, regardless of how compelling these opportunities appear, more weight seems to be given to the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies than to the risks. Before embracing cryptocurrencies, local leaders should ask themselves:
What problems are we trying to solve and, more importantly, why?
Can or should cryptocurrencies solve these problems, and are the risks greater than the benefits?
Could these problems be solved without cryptocurrencies?
This is not meant to suggest mayors should oppose innovation. But the premise that innovation will automatically lead to positive outcomes should be scrutinized. There are disadvantages to be mindful of given the lack of cryptocurrency regulations to ensure adequate consumer protection, as well as the potential risks to the broader financial system.
As the federal government attempts to develop a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, local leaders should exercise caution before promoting cryptocurrencies or establishing policies without adequately understanding how they function. As part of their assessments, mayors and other local leaders should examine the use cases for cryptocurrencies, how cryptocurrencies operate, how attracting crypto businesses may affect local economies, and how local leaders can improve financial access and wealth-building opportunities for their communities beyond cryptocurrencies.
Defining common cryptocurrency terms
The confusion surrounding cryptocurrencies is reasonable given the terminology is still fluctuating and contested, with many unsettled definitions. Below are working definitions for some common terms; however, this is not a comprehensive or definitive list, as the terms will continue to evolve over time.
Fintech, or financial services technology, is technology that enables companies, business owners, and consumers to provide or access financial services. The development and use of cryptocurrencies fall under the fintech umbrella. There are many different types of fintech companies providing various products and services, such as mobile payments, international payments, digital lending, and retail investing.
Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value, whose movements are tracked on a blockchain record. Cryptocurrencies are created, traded, and stored digitally. Thousands of cryptocurrencies exist; bitcoin, ethereum, and dogecoin are some examples.
Stablecoins are a subcategory of cryptocurrencies, but these digital assets are distinct because they are designed to be pegged to a fiat currency. They are not, however, issued by a central bank, nor are there currently standards or public information requirements regarding a stablecoin’s reserve assets. Presently, U.S. federal lawmakers are evaluating the systemic risks that stablecoins pose and potential legislation to provide safeguards.
Blockchain technology, which uses a particular data structure consisting of a chain of blocks of data, is considered by some to be a subset of the broader distributed ledger technology (DLT) universe. A DLT system is a distributed record-keeping system, rather than a centralized one, and is collectively maintained and updated by multiple nodes. In this case, think of people on different computers seeing changes made to the ledger at the same time. Blockchain is the technology that enables cryptocurrency transactions. A blockchain can be public, which is how most cryptocurrencies operate, or it can be private, which is limited to a select group of verified participants.
Bitcoin mining is a resource-intensive process of verifying transactions, adding them to the ledger, and creating new bitcoins. To verify a transaction, “miners” use computing hardware to solve complex math problems, and once solved, “blocks” of verified transactions get added to the ledger, and the miner that succeeds in solving the problem is rewarded with bitcoin.
Though “cryptocurrency,” “blockchain,” and “bitcoin” are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same. More importantly, if someone claims that blockchain technology can solve a specific subset of problems, it does not mean cryptocurrencies can as well.
Cryptocurrency is inherently risky to treat as a public good
Before promoting cryptocurrencies and treating them as a public good, mayors and other local leaders should be aware of the technological landscape they aim to adopt. They should consider the use cases first, since cryptocurrencies have so far shown little utility despite much hype. Moreover, they should examine the fundamental characteristics of cryptocurrencies and how they function prior to designing policies based on a poor understanding of the technology.
Using cryptocurrencies as a payment option is one possible use case that local leaders have promoted. But there are some disadvantages to keep in mind. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and their dramatic price fluctuations make them poor payment methods for daily transactions. A transaction made in bitcoin today could result in a significant loss tomorrow if, for instance, the price of bitcoin skyrockets the next day. And unlike cash, cryptocurrencies are still not universally accepted. Moreover, as Brookings’s Eswar Prasad noted, transactions using cryptocurrencies can be slow and costly: Bitcoin transactions can take about 10 minutes to be validated, with an average fee of about $20 for just one transaction. In El Salvador, which adopted bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, residents are experiencing high fees on both ends of their transactions, price volatility, and technical issues such as lost transactions, error codes when making payments, and accounts created through identity fraud.
Common criticisms of cryptocurrencies are usually based on how people, businesses, or organizations use them to conduct illicit transactions or commit cybercrimes, including money laundering. To be fair, cash can also be used in this way. Even so, local leaders should be aware that crypto is rife with scams. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has reported an increase in complaints about cryptocurrencies, including crypto companies and exchanges, from 488 complaints in 2019 to 979 in 2020 and more than 1,400 in 2021.
Beyond these concerns on how people use cryptocurrencies is a much larger one: Local leaders need to consider the risks regarding how cryptocurrencies operate and their basic characteristics. Legal scholars such as Angela Walch stress that some cryptocurrencies’ fundamental features carry operational risks that make them unsuitable to serve as money, due to technology vulnerabilities or basic governance problems. Bitcoin, for example, works as money only if the software itself is functioning—but what happens if there are software bugs or cyberattacks?
Mayors and local leaders should be aware that many cryptocurrency proponents make claims perceived as factual, but in reality are more aspirational. For example, they may emphasize the “immutability” of the blockchain database as a selling point, arguing that the blockchain cannot be altered and therefore is “tamper-proof” or “secure.” Walch, who studies the nascent field of cryptocurrency governance structures, points out that the distributed ledger system is not in fact “immutable,” and there are developers in these public blockchain spaces maintaining a considerable amount of decisionmaking power. There have been instances when a small group of developers, some of whom Walch likens to fiduciaries, have made a call on behalf of the larger group to address bugs or theft in the system, sometimes altering the underlying code. As Walch stresses, this type of decisionmaking power raises important questions: How will these decisions be made? Will only software experts make them? Is it possible that a small group of investors will end up making decisions? If so, who can stop them if there are no accountability systems? These are critical questions for local leaders to scrutinize before promoting specific cryptocurrencies.
While regulators are still figuring out a framework for regulating these technologies, some are also urging more thought be put into clarifying blockchain law and governance to better understand the roles various actors play in these spaces and create systems of accountability. In the meantime, mayors should proceed with caution: Before romanticizing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology and making policy decisions based on assumptions about the technology, they should aim to better understand it—following a similar approach that Walch suggests regulators take:
Adopt a critical approach in their education process and seek diverse perspectives, including across disciplines.
Interrogate whether the technologies’ capabilities are actually demonstrated and seek to understand how they accomplish what proponents claim they do.
Consider the source making claims about the technologies and that source’s incentives.
Mayors should think about how crypto will impact residents
Mayors who want to transform their cities into crypto hubs claim new jobs would be created and new workers would move in. As a result, local leaders are trying different tactics to attract crypto businesses, including city-branded cryptocurrency projects. Some states are offering tax incentives to lure bitcoin mining companies, and cities such as Miami and Austin, Texas are promoting their low energy costs and competitive tax rates.
Even so, local leaders must weigh how crypto companies might affect their current residents and workforce. Consideration should be given to potential environmental effects (including energy usage) and how the promotion of specific cryptocurrencies may encourage residents to engage in speculation. They should also assess whether there are ways to ensure residents are not displaced and can benefit from economic development efforts.
Undoubtedly, crypto businesses would affect cities’ energy use and climate goals, as well as residents’ energy bills. Cryptocurrencies using a “proof of work” protocol, such as bitcoin, require energy-intensive verification processes. One analysis found that bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than the entire country of Argentina. It is important to note that several cryptocurrencies were designed to minimize energy consumption, and not all operate like bitcoin. Even so, it is crucial to highlight this environmental impact, since many mayors who have promoted cryptocurrencies have embraced bitcoin in particular. Local leaders must consider how their communities will cope with the mining process, its high energy consumption, and the spillover effects to local economies. For instance, one working paper found that in upstate New York—where a quarter of all U.S. crypto mining occurs—energy bills have gone up because of the increased demand for electricity, with small businesses and households paying an additional $79 million and $165 million, respectively, in annual electricity bill costs.
Furthermore, local leaders should evaluate whether cryptocurrency’s broader economic benefits are overstated. Despite incentives offered by states to lure crypto-mining companies, Brookings’s Eswar Prasad noted some of these mining facilities would require few, if any, workers to operate them. Furthermore, a crypto-related company’s headquarters may be located elsewhere, or nowhere at all, which limits a locality’s tax benefits. Prasad also pointed out that the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining, including the diversion of energy from other uses, will remain local.
Local leaders should also be mindful of how city-branded cryptocurrency projects could affect their residents. Despite the seemingly appealing prospect of “fundraising” for a city through city-branded cryptocurrency projects, these initiatives have raised questions that local authorities should consider. Some of these questions include whether the projects encourage speculation among residents or whether proper due diligence was performed.
For example, MiamiCoin lets people who want to support the city invest in it, whether they live in Miami or not. Yet MiamiCoin presently has no utility, so critics say Mayor Suarez is encouraging speculation, drawing comparisons to gambling and pyramid schemes. MiamiCoin’s arrangement also raises important questions about accountability, since its creator, CityCoins, is not a company, but rather a group of unknown individuals registered in Delaware as a nonprofit and communicating over Discord. Moreover, though Mayor Suarez celebrated the $5.25 million gifted to Miami from the project, the city may need to rethink the initiative given the coin’s volatility, as its value fell by nearly 93% recently, and it is not entirely clear that the city’s leaders fully understand the project or know how to effectively manage the digital assets. Local leaders should follow this case study with a critical eye before making a commitment to such initiatives.
Finally, mayors and policy staffers should examine how incentives they use to attract crypto businesses will affect current residents. In Puerto Rico, for example, tax incentives designed to attract crypto, tech, and finance investors are driving up housing costs and displacing low-income Puerto Ricans. And in Miami, the soaring cost of living—due to the influx of wealthy newcomers—is outpacing the promised tech job growth. Local leaders may be tempted to focus on attracting companies and workers because they receive attention-grabbing headlines for such efforts. But instead of concentrating on new workers they hope to attract, mayors should consider investing in their existing workforce instead.
Democratize finance and wealth creation beyond cryptocurrencies
Earlier this year, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez took over as head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and, laying out his vision for American cities, he proposed cities sign onto a “crypto compact.” Mayors at the conference expressed interest in crypto’s potential to address the financial needs of low-income communities and the unbanked or underbanked.
Indeed, cryptocurrency advocates often cite financial inclusion as one of their main objectives. There is a growing number of people of color and the underbanked who are trying their hand at cryptocurrencies, taking on huge risks in the hopes of gaining some semblance of wealth. A Harris poll showed 20% of Latino or Hispanic Americans, 18% of Black Americans, and 13% of white Americans own cryptocurrency. Another survey found 37% of the underbanked own cryptocurrency, versus 10% of the fully banked. Historically, these groups have been denied access to traditional financial institutions and their services, so it is understandable they seek alternative financial service providers for making transactions and generating wealth. They may also be tempted to engage with cryptocurrencies due to the constant promotion by celebrities, athletes, influencers, and the already wealthy—who, by virtue of their wealth and ability to arbitrage, face few risks when dealing in speculative assets.
Despite the belief that cryptocurrencies could “democratize finance” or even wealth, the growing concentration of the wealthy in these spaces demonstrates that not all cryptocurrency holders are created equal. Ownership of bitcoin is becoming increasingly more concentrated in a small group of investors, with 0.01% of bitcoin holders controlling 27% of the currency in circulation. In addition, cryptocurrency mining has become so expensive that only a small group of companies and people can afford to do it, with approximately 10% of miners controlling 90% of bitcoin mining capacity. Given the concentration of wealthy investors and miners in these areas, can local leaders be confident the market will not be manipulated to benefit only a few?
Local leaders would be wise to contemplate whether cryptocurrencies are an adequate remedy for highly complex social problems rooted in decades of systemic financial discrimination. Or, if local leaders are simply viewing cryptocurrencies as another tool in the toolbox, they should evaluate whether it is the right tool given the risks. Due to their constrained choices, communities of color have a history of using expensive, complicated, or risky alternative financial services, many of which are marketed to these communities, including payday loans, check-cashing services, and subprime mortgages. Similar to how cryptocurrencies are currently depicted, payday loans were once described as a way to promote the “democratization” of credit, and subprime mortgages were heralded as “innovations” that would open doors for excluded communities—but ultimately hurt them during the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. Mayors should ask themselves: Should the worst-case scenario occur and the digital bubble burst, are they prepared to shoulder the blame for promoting digital assets that exposed their most vulnerable constituents to significant financial risk?
Instead of signing a “crypto compact,” mayors should consider using their energy, influence, and collective action to push the federal government to address systemic racism in financial services systems and close the racial wealth gap. Indeed, many resources and policy proposals are available to address the root causes of financial access and wealth disparities. Local leaders could champion policies that open payment systems to the unbanked and underbanked.
Recently, the 12 district banks of the Federal Reserve System hosted a “Racism and the Economy” series to examine the impact of structural racism on our economy. The series shared several proposals to improve economic outcomes for all Americans, many of which local leaders could certainly champion. And in terms of closing the racial wealth gap, Brookings scholars offer a number of recommendations, including supporting credit-scoring practices with fewer discriminatory effects and providing credit and down payment assistance to borrowers affected by discriminatory housing and lending practices. Mayors can also stand behind national, evidence-based efforts to cancel student loan debt, launch baby bonds, or provide a guaranteed income to residents.
Ultimately, if the intention is to advocate for greater economic opportunities for marginalized communities, local leaders should support policies which help them reduce debt and grow wealth rather than promote unregulated digital assets with limited utility.
Cryptocurrencies should remind us to take a step back
There are of course other practical and tactical considerations for local leaders to keep in mind regarding cryptocurrencies. For instance, once they have done the work to understand how people use cryptocurrencies and how they operate, local leaders may need to evaluate the technological capabilities of their cities, legal hurdles, and even state regulatory barriers to do things like accept payments or incorporate cryptocurrencies into their investment strategies. They should also consider the role city councils will play in decisionmaking regarding city-branded crypto projects, as these governing bodies are typically responsible for city government financial and budgetary issues.
On a more profound note, however, mayors and local leaders should take a step back and think carefully about the problems they are trying to solve and why. By doing so, they may find that many of the challenges they seek to address are fundamentally social problems requiring policy solutions rather than technological ones. Or, they might recognize that some of these problems have existed over generations and run deeper than any one new tool can solve, particularly one with limited utility. In any case, local leaders should remember that they are accountable to the public, and the public deserves having their local leaders conduct a full assessment of this opaque technological landscape. Given the current risks and drawbacks when it comes to cryptocurrencies, mayors should exercise caution."

SAN SALVADOR, March 23 (Reuters) - El Salvador is seeking support from cryptocurrency exchange Binance for its implementation of bitcoin as legal tender and the issuance of bitcoin bonds, the Central American country's ambassador to the United States said on Wednesday.
Binance Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao is visiting El Salvador and plans to meet President Nayib Bukele on Thursday, ambassador Milena Mayorga told reporters.
Mayorga said Zhao's visit was a vote of confidence in Bukele's decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender last September, as well as its plan to issue bitcoin-backed bonds.

Zhao praised El Salvador for taking on a pioneering role in the adoption of bitcoin and said Bukele's presidency would be remembered in ""heroic"" terms for its bold bet on the future.
The country's adoption of bitcoin has been beset by public skepticism about the cryptocurrency, which has depreciated substantially since hitting a record high in early November.
On Tuesday, the government said it was delaying its planned issuance of bitcoin bonds. read more

Zavalny explained that Russia is open to accepting different currencies for its exports, beginning with natural gas, depending on the buyer’s preferred method of payment. However, the chairman said terms will depend on the importing country’s foreign relations status with Russia.
“When it comes to our ‘friendly’ countries, like China or Turkey, which don’t pressure us, then we have been offering them for a while to switch payments to national currencies, like rubles and yuan,” Zavalny said during the press conference. “With Turkey, it can be lira and rubles. So there can be a variety of currencies, and that’s a standard practice. If they want bitcoin, we will trade in bitcoin.”
Zavalny’s statement comes on the heels of President Vladimir Putin’s comments on Wednesday demanding that ‘unfriendly’ countries pay for Russian gas in rubles. Putin’s message was clear, but it is unclear whether Russia can unilaterally change existing contracts agreed upon in euros.
The State Duma’s energy committee chair echoed Putin’s decision while adding that the country should also accept gold.
“When we exchange with Western countries…they should pay in hard money,” Zavalny said. “And hard money is gold, or they must pay in currencies which are convenient for us, and that is the national currency – ruble. That relates to our ‘unfriendly’ countries.”
Russia being open to accepting bitcoin shift the tide as Putin last year had dismissed the possibility in an interview at the Russian Energy Week event in Moscow.
“I believe that it has value,” Putin said at the time, referring to Bitcoin. “But I don’t believe it can be used in the oil trade.”
The current size of the Bitcoin market and its liquidity do pose questions as to whether the peer-to-peer currency could be used widely by countries in international trade at this moment.
However, by being open to the possibility and eventually conducting pilot trades with interested parties, Russia could set the stage for an upcoming trend where nations choose to transact in the stateless, global monetary system.

In a videotaped news conference held on Thursday, the chair of Russia's Duma committee on energy said in translated remarks that when it comes to ""friendly"" countries such as China or Turkey, Russia is willing to be more flexible with payment options.

218,2022-03-24,2022-03-24,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Özgür Töre,ftnnews.com,Five Amazing Advantages Of Traveling The World With Bitcoin,"Are you aware of the unique characteristics of Crypto money, which is quite popular worldwide and especially today in international or local travel?",https://ftnnews.com/tours/43627-five-amazing-advantages-of-travelling-the-world-with-bitcoin,"You probably must have heard about Bitcoin from someone who is into trading. But are you aware of the unique characteristics of Crypto money, which is quite popular worldwide and especially today in international or local travel?
Yes, you guessed right, it can be remarkably used while travelling from one location to another. But you must consider a few points before using Bitcoin for your travel expenses. First, Bitcoin is undoubtedly an essentially new form of digital money. Check the bitcoin profit official trading site to get a piece of detailed information about bitcoin trading.
The first cryptocurrency was introduced by the Japanese scientist Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. BTC has the same working as the government and issues the money for sale, purchase, transaction across the border, and many more. However, some exciting points make cryptocurrency more influential and popular than the physical form. For example, unlike any other bill, cryptocurrency does not ask its users to carry cash in their wallets or purses.
You can easily store the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin in the Bitcoin wallet. Moreover, the user can exercise different Bitcoin wallets, such as hardware, desktop, mobile, and many more.
Significant Advantages Of Using Bitcoin While Travelling
Book Flights
Many individuals are not aware that several Airlines happily accept cryptocurrency for the payment and booking of flights. In addition, the airline provides complete assistance to travellers to use Bitcoin. Moreover, more than 70 airlines help their customers with the process and ensure they have fun while travelling. Don't you think that using cryptocurrency makes the entire process seamless for the users?
Conversion
While travelling from one country to another, one issue regularly faced by the Travellers is the exchange of money. When people travel to a different country, they have to exchange the money in the local currency of that country. The conversion might take a lot of time because it is not an easy process. Every country sets some strict rules for tourists, and it is mandatory to follow to avoid trouble.
Meanwhile, people who use cryptocurrency do not have to face the issue of converting money. They can easily use the Crypto fund for the purchase of goods and services. It is one of the highly appreciated services provided by the BTC. The individual can easily use the Bitcoin wallet, which is installed in their smartphone. Another fantastic thing about Bitcoin is the development of the Bitcoin ATM, which works in the same manner as a traditional ATM. Around 71 countries globally have supported Bitcoin and the Bitcoin ATM.
Travel Agencies
If you want to enjoy your trip with a complete package, you can hire a travel agency that will provide you with a complete fun package. A travel agency makes sure that the customers are happy with the services of Hotel accommodation, tickets, meals and leisure activities. Today the travel agency accepts cryptocurrency for the payment of the above services. Therefore, you can quickly look for different services and check about the fees.
Shopping
Apart from booking your hotel rooms through Bitcoin, several other things can be enjoyed by you via cryptocurrency. While travelling, one thing that attracts a lot of people is shopping. Usually, it has been noticed that whenever somebody visits a different country, they like to purchase one memory figure or goodies. There are so many places and stores that welcome users who want to make payments through BTC.
As discussed above, several countries have offered legal status to Bitcoin and are establishing Bitcoin ATMs. It even makes it easier for merchants to accept cryptocurrency. Moreover, whenever a person purchases or makes payments through Bitcoin, they are awarded hundreds of gift cards.
Cheaper Payment
As we are already aware of many perks provided by the unique money, It is vital to determine how Bitcoin is tremendously decentralizing the money system. Bitcoin is not managed by the administration or any legal higher authority. It is a self-functioning and independent body. However, talking about the cheaper payment transaction through Bitcoin is straightforward as you can easily send, store, monitor, and receive the funds with your smartphone. There is no requirement of carrying the money or worrying about safety.
The above advantages highlight the importance of using cryptocurrency while travelling. Furthermore, it shows how much potential Bitcoin holds for travellers who want to see the world."

Earlier today, the crypto king spiked to an intraday high of $45,137 on the Bitstamp exchange, reaching its highest price point since March 2. The cryptocurrency, however, has already given up the majority of its gains, sliding back to the $44,200 level. Bitcoin is still up roughly 9% over the past 24 hours.

At the same time, Bollinger argues that the $3,200 is “a key pivot” for Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency. The flagship altcoin touched $3,195 earlier today, the highest level since Feb. 10, on the Coinbase exchange before paring its gains in tandem with Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is currently trading in the red, hovering just above the $3,100 level.
Bollinger believes that Ethereum could lead the upcoming rally, urging his followers to pay attention.The biggest altcoin is so far down 11% against Bitcoin in 2022 with risk-off sentiment dominating the price action of the cryptocurrency market.Ethereum posted monstrous gains in 2021, with the ETH/BTC pair surging a whopping 403%. The cryptocurrency benefited from the Cambrian explosion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which dominated headlines throughout the year.While Ethereum has so far underperformed in 2022, many analysts that it will steal the spotlight ahead of the hotly-anticipated upgrade dubbed the “merge,” which is tentatively scheduled for this summer. As reported by U.Today , the second-largest blockchain is expected to consume 99.95% less energy once it transitions to the proof-of-stake mechanism. It remains to be seen whether Ethereum will be able to topple Bitcoin’s market cap."

That means crypto buyers have less conviction on price rises, which could point to limited upside.

Bitcoin moved past its $45,000 price ceiling, after it was reported that the Russian government was considering accepting it as payment for energies. The news sent BTC to a 24-day high, whilst ETH also climbed to a five-week peak.
Bitcoin
BTC was trading almost 5% higher on Friday, as markets reacted to the news that Russia was considering accepting it as payment for oil and gas.
Following a low of $42,753.56 during Thursday’s session, BTC/USD climbed to an intraday high of $45,046.08 on Friday.
This is the highest price bitcoin has hit in 24 days and comes following a breakout of the $42,500 resistance level.
Friday’s rally sees bitcoin prices climb for the fourth consecutive session, gaining over 11% in that time period.
The move pushed price strength beyond its own ceiling, as the 14-day RSI moved past its resistance level of 62.33, and now tracks at 63.83.
Should this run continue, and BTC move beyond $46,000, it would reach its highest level in almost four months.
Ethereum
ETH was not to be left behind on Friday, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency also surged to a multi-week high.
Ethereum climbed to an intraday high of $3,183.96 during today’s session, which is the highest point at which it has traded since February 10.
Today’s gains means that ETH has now climbed for 11 of the last 12 sessions, gaining over 15% within that period.
Looking at the chart, should this bullish strength persist, we could be looking at $3,300 as the price ceiling.
However, the RSI now tracks at 66.6, as it continues to hover in overbought territory, which could be an obstacle to further gains.
Could we see further highs this weekend for both ETH and BTC? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

During the last month, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been coasting along above the 200 exahash per second (EH/s) zone, minus a number of drops here and there above and below that range. Following two difficulty changes that saw the difficulty decrease by 1.84%, the network’s difficulty is expected to increase 4.24% within the next 13 hours.
Bitcoin’s Difficulty Expected to Reach All-Time High
Bitcoin miners caught two breaks during the last month when the difficulty dropped two times in a row. The first 1.49% drop occurred at block height 725,760 on March 3, 2022, and the second decrease was a 0.35% drop, which occurred at block height 727,776 on March 17, 2022.
The two consecutive drops made it 1.84% easier for all the mining participants to find BTC blocks. While the difficulty was 27.97 trillion prior to the two reductions, the current difficulty is 27.45 trillion on Wednesday morning at 8:00 a.m. (ET). Within the next 13 hours, the difficulty is expected to increase this time around, jumping 4.24% higher if current estimations are correct.
With an expected 4.24% difficulty increase taking place, Bitcoin’s network difficulty will break records by reaching an all-time high (ATH). If the difficulty increases 4.24%, then the difficulty will be 28.62 trillion for the next two weeks that follow. Miners will deal with the hardest difficulty parameter they have ever dealt with in their mining careers.
Moreover, the difficulty changes that have taken place since January 1, 2020, after block height 610,848, moved at the fastest pace in the network’s lifetime. For instance, it took 4,015 days to get to a difficulty rating of 13.80 trillion, or over ten years. From that point after block height 610,848, with a difficulty rating of 13.80 trillion, it took only 820 days or just over two years to reach the current 27.45 trillion.
At the time of writing, the network’s hashrate is coasting along at 204.27 EH/s and has remained high during the last two weeks. While the hashrate has been fluctuating it has tapped a low of 153.97 EH/s on March 6, and a high of 246.88 EH/s on March 22. At the same time, the top mining pool on Wednesday is Foundry USA with 17.54% of the global hashrate. Foundry USA has 35.88 EH/s of hashpower and has found 77 blocks during the last three days.
In terms of global hashrate positions, Foundry USA is followed by Antpool, Binance Pool, Poolin, and F2pool, respectively. Over the last 30 days, Foundry USA and Antpool have been the top two mining pools finding the most blocks (1,480 blocks combined) last month. It will be interesting to see how the mining pools deal with the upcoming difficulty ATH. Observers will be watching to see how bitcoin miners and the hashrate react to the epoch difficulty change.

According to Nansen, Ethereum gas fees have been very high recently, which has typically been a solid indicator of a shift to more risk-on investor behavior.
“Bitcoin dropped in the early hours of the morning, after the largest blockchain game Axie Infinity suffered a $625 million hack ,” wrote Global Block in its newsletter. “The dip has been bought up as bitcoin remains above $47,000, showing great strength amongst the news of the hack.”
The hack happened in cross-chain bridges that are secured by only one centralized computer.
MacroStrategy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the enterprise analytics and mobility software provider MicroStrategy (MSTR) that invests in bitcoin as its central business strategy, has obtained a $205 million loan collateralized by bitcoins from Silvergate Bank.
MacroStrategy can use the loan to purchase bitcoin or pay interest and fees related to the loan or for its or MicroStrategy’s general corporate needs.
Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a non-profit organization focused on UST, resumed buying the largest cryptocurrency after taking a break on Tuesday. It has purchased 5,773 BTC, worth $272 million, this week.
“The buy pressure of MicroStrategy and Luna Foundation Guard is understandably contributing to a strong uptrend in the short-term,” Global Block wrote.
“It could be a simple lull now that MicroStrategy and Terra have paused their buying at this moment” said Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics. “But it could also be a period of simple consolidation after an eight day run.”
If it is a consolidation, “these are often considered a bullish indicator, as it gives the market time to build a new base on which to make further price discovery,” Deane told CoinDesk."

Unchained is a crypto podcast hosted by Laura Shin. Shin was the first mainstream media journalist to cover crypto full time at Forbes and is also the author of the newly released book “The Cryptopians” — a must read page tuner on the origin stories of Ethereum.
The show is known for delivering a constant flow of up-to-date information on the top crypto stories of the day. For example, when UST lost its peg, they were the first show to have a relevant guest on speaking the facts of the situation, and provided an extra-long episode to make sure their listeners were well informed. They are true trailblazers of the industry as the show sets the pace for what is relevant each and every week.
The crypto show also has an impressive array of guests, including the CEO of Binance who goes by CZ, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, as well as many other founders and leaders in the industry. There is even a selection of great episodes for beginners, like their show on “How to explain cryptocurrency to the average person.”
A surprising fact that I later learned about the host Laura Shin is that, despite being a proponent of the potential of cryptocurrency, she’s a nocoiner (meaning she doesn’t invest in bitcoin or any other digital currencies.)

Kuchta,Learn About Our,Editorial Process",www.treehugger.com,Why Cryptocurrency Is Bad for the Environment,"Cryptocurrency is an energy-intensive industry. Learn about its environmental impact, as well as how it could become more sustainable over time.",https://www.treehugger.com/why-cryptocurrency-is-bad-for-the-environment-5222940,"Is cryptocurrency bad for the environment? Yes. Indeed, all economic activity contributes to a collective environmental impact. But why and how is cryptocurrency worse compared to other forms of money?
This article provides an overview of cryptocurrency's footprint and discusses potential environmental improvements—some of which we are already seeing take place in the industry.
What Is Cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency is money existing only in digital form, with Bitcoin being the original and most well-known. It exists as bits of data stored in blockchains—networks of computers each with an open-source copy of the entire currency's ledger of transactions, making forgery and fraud virtually impossible.
Environmental Impacts of Cryptocurrency
The problem with cryptocurrencies is their energy consumption. The majority of that consumption comes from crypto-mining, which is the use of computers to solve increasingly difficult 64-digit strings of random numbers and letters.
The “miner” who solves this riddle first is rewarded with new Bitcoins or other currencies, which can earn the miner hundreds of thousands of dollars. This has led to a Gold Rush-like search for faster and more powerful computers—and higher and higher amounts of energy consumed.
In 2021, Bitcoin mining alone consumed an estimated 121.36 terawatt-hours (TWh)—more electricity than Argentina, or roughly what's annually used by vampire power in the United States.
One influential 2018 article in Nature Climate Change warned, “Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2 degrees C.” (The article has been criticized for not adequately accounting for the different sources of electricity Bitcoin mining uses, an estimated 50% of which are renewable.) Indeed, the energy needs of cryptocurrencies have become an issue of major concern, leading to a Congressional hearing on “Cleaning Up Cryptocurrency: The Energy Impacts of Blockchains” in January 2022.
What About NFTs? NFTs (non-fungible tokens) work similarly to cryptocurrencies, since they are unique digital items (like artwork) stored in blockchains—and they consume 10 times the amount of electricity. Many NFTs are purchased using the energy-hungry cryptocurrency Ethereum.
Crypto vs. Traditional Currency
Criticisms of cryptocurrencies are often made without comparison to other forms of money. Unlike the rest of the money economy, cryptocurrencies exist with few other energy costs other than computers: no banks, no printing of paper money, no mining of gold or metals for coins, no transportation costs, and so on.
The traditional banking sector emits an estimated 1,368 Megatonnes (Mtoe) of carbon each year, and gold mining another 144 Mtoe. Bitcoin mining produces roughly 61 Mtoe a year. That said, the traditional banking sector serves far more people and conducts far more transactions, and cryptocurrency is rapidly growing.
Estimates of the carbon footprint of the entire money economy are nearly impossible to calculate, while cryptocurrencies' footprint is easier to identify—and, possibly, easier to improve.
Can Crypto Become Sustainable?

Cryptocurrencies consist of the consumption of electricity and electronic equipment. This means, unlike other parts of the money economy, it is potentially much easier to make cryptocurrencies more environmentally friendly.
The most important way to improve the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies is to clean up electricity production and reduce its e-waste. A carbon tax on fossil fuels would do more than anything else to reduce the carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies.
Short of a carbon tax, the cryptocurrency world is attempting to clean up its own act. Part of that involves devising less energy-intensive forms of crypto-mining. Many miners have signed the Crypto Climate Accords, pledging to make their own currencies net-zero by 2030 and to decarbonize the entire industry by 2040. Pressed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the Bitcoin Mining Council was formed to promote greater transparency in crypto-miners' energy consumption and pressure them to use a greater share of clean energy.
Also driving decarbonization is the nature of the business itself. Since crypto-mining's energy consumption is its largest cost, crypto-miners move their operations to places where energy is cheap, just as data centers have. With solar energy now the cheapest form of electricity in history and wind power close behind, the more we decarbonize our electricity production, the cheaper and cleaner crypto-mining will become.
The Necessity of Curtailment
Crypto-mining is helping drive the installation of clean energy. With that, electricity is cheapest when it is being reduced to what is only necessary.
In 2017, China curtailed 41.9 terawatt-hours (TWh) of wind electricity and 7.3 TWh of solar—more than the estimated amount of electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining that year. The opportunity is a global one: in 2020 California alone curtailed 1.5 TWh of solar electricity.
As John Belizaire, a developer of green data centers for cryptocurrency mining who testified before Congress, explained: When crypto-miners purchase renewable energy that will otherwise have to be curtailed, they lower their own costs and increase the profits of renewable energy developers, stimulating more investment in renewables.
Electricity production is being decarbonized faster than any other sector of the global economy, which is why climate activists insist that we “electrify everything” as a key step in fighting climate change.
Cryptocurrencies are presently an energy-intensive industry. But the good news is that it is easier to decarbonize an industry that is already nearly 100% electrified than one that is not."
231,2022-03-31,2022-03-31,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Peter Howson,theconversation.com,Bitcoin: Greenpeace says a code change could slash cryptocurrency energy use - here’s why it’s not so simple,"Proof of Work mining is inherently wasteful, but don’t expect a switch any time soon.",https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-greenpeace-says-a-code-change-could-slash-cryptocurrency-energy-use-heres-why-its-not-so-simple-180264,"Fewer and fewer people are using bitcoin for digital payments. Nevertheless, bitcoin transactions are consuming more energy than ever before – the same amount as the whole of Thailand. With a carbon footprint equivalent to the Czech Republic’s (around 114 million tonnes per year), bitcoin is cancelling out other climate wins.
The global take-up of electric vehicles, for example, is estimated to have prevented 50 million tonnes of CO₂ so far. That’s less than half of bitcoin’s emissions for a single year. And the problem’s getting worse. The growth of bitcoin “mining” powered by fossil fuels is outpacing greener alternatives, causing bitcoin’s carbon footprint to swell five-fold in just two years.
But, according to campaign groups Greenpeace and the Environmental Working Group, all this can be easily fixed with a simple update to bitcoin’s software. Their campaign, called Change the Code Not the Climate, launched recently and calls on bitcoin software developers to switch the network from its currently wasteful system for verifying transactions to a more climate-friendly alternative.
The switch, they claim, would reduce bitcoin’s carbon footprint by 99.9%. But it’s unlikely to happen soon – and here’s why.
Proof of waste to proof of stake?
Bitcoiners don’t trust bankers, taxmen and other meddling middlemen. Because there are no banks with bitcoin, the job of keeping the books straight is given to a global network of specialist computers. The owners of these computers compete for bookkeeping tasks in return for the transaction fees paid by network users. They also get a few newly minted bitcoins as a thank you.
This competition is known as Proof of Work (PoW) mining. It works like an ever-expanding game of hungry hippos. The more players that join the contest, the more work each hippo needs to do in order to win anything. If a new hippo with green intentions joins the game, everyone at the table has to work harder. Players powered by coal in Kazakhstan, or fossil gas in Texas, then belch out extra smog.
The higher the bitcoin price, the more the dirty hippos are prepared to waste on coal and gas until their costs for doing so are equal to their reward. And so, Proof of Work is proof of waste. And this is waste by design: Bitcoiners call this inefficiency “the feature, not the bug”.
Greenpeace hopes the bitcoin community could learn to love Proof of Stake (PoS) instead. With the network running on PoS, bitcoin’s bookkeepers would need to stake a prescribed minimum number of bitcoins as a security deposit. If they validate fraudulent transactions, they lose their stake. This disincentive keeps the network secure.
A number of blockchains, including Cardano, EOS, and TRON already use a PoS system, where token holders vote for the most qualified block producers. While bitcoin currently uses millions of mining computers, these PoS networks usually maintain an assembly of around 20 machines using a comparably minuscule amount of energy, taking turns to receive bookkeeping rights.
Code blockers
For bitcoin, coding these changes would be straightforward. Greenpeace claims that only 30 people – the largest mining outfits, exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, and code developers – would need to agree the switch to PoS.
But this ignores the fact that everyone would need to run the upgraded software. On average, to successfully mine bitcoin once per week requires shelling out around US$1.8 million (£1.4 million) on hardware. Most miners are protective of these investments and conservative when it comes to amending the software code that underwrites their winnings.
For this reason, Chris Bendiksen, a commentator at the cryptocurrency website CoinShares, puts the chance of Bitcoin ever moving to PoS at 0%. “There is no appetite among Bitcoiners to destroy the security of the protocol by making such a move”, he says.
Bitcoin is no stranger to coding stalemates. An amendment to fix intermittent congestion issues and stabilise transaction fees was proposed in 2016. Despite being a relatively simple fix, the change split the bitcoin community, with the vast majority continuing to support the slower, more expensive status quo.
Even if some users were prepared to ditch PoW, the original bitcoin network would continue in some form. This PoW version would keep the name, branding, super-rich disciples, and polluting PoW miners. The PoS offshoot could end up as just another disappointing experiment.
Another PoW heavyweight network, Ethereum, has been promising a shift to PoS since birth. But this migration has remained just around the corner for several years.
Starting a PoS network from scratch is another option. But there is already a BitcoinPoS cryptocurrency. Aside from an early flurry of interest, it’s attracted few supporters.

Tackling crypto greenwashing
Many Bitcoiners scoffed at the Greenpeace campaign. After all, much of the funding for this marketing mission comes from billionaire venture capitalist Chris Larsen, co-founder of rival cryptocurrency Ripple.
Larsen’s Ripple was also an original member of the UN-backed Crypto Climate Accord, an organisation convened in April 2021 to promote more sustainable cryptocurrency trading. In response, prominent bitcoin advocates established the Bitcoin Mining Council – a public relations group aiming to “defend bitcoin against uninformed and hostile energy critics”, like Larsen.
Some argue governments in Europe and North America should follow China’s lead and ban PoW mining.
Retaliatory campaigns from bitcoin advocates are ramping up, and their greenwashing appears to be winning. The European Parliament recently rejected a bill to ban PoW mining across the EU. The UK government also fears an exodus of crypto trading talent for other financial centres.
Research I have led suggests that effective regulation of bitcoin will not come from charity appeals. A globally coordinated ban, led by governments, is likely to prove the most effective solution.

232,2022-03-31,2022-03-31,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,William Suberg,cointelegraph.com,Bitcoin just regained a key price trendline after its longest absence since March 2020,Bitcoin is back from a trip below a key moving average which outlasted the COVID-19 BTC price crash.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-just-regained-a-key-price-trendline-after-its-longest-absence-since-march-2020,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be consolidating at $47,000, but longer timeframes show just how significant this week’s mini bull run has been.
According to the Golden Ratio Multiplier (GRM) metric, on March 27, BTC/USD reclaimed an essential support zone for securing further upside.
Bitcoin exits trendline slump that beat March 2020
GRM is a long-term observational metric for Bitcoin price action. It is used to determine whether Bitcoin price growth (or the opposite) is overstretched relative to its overall maturity as an asset in terms of adoption.
It does so using a log scale, which comprises Bitcoin’s 350-day moving average (DMA) and Fibonacci sequences to give multiples of that trendline.
As such, BTC/USD dropping below the 350DMA is a now conspicuous sign of outlier price action, as the vast majority of days have been spent above it since mid-2019.
As Bitcoin matures and adoption spreads, logarithmic extremes become less pronounced.
“The Golden Ratio Multiplier is an effective tool because it is able to demonstrate when the market is likely overstretched within the context of Bitcoin’s adoption curve growth and market cycles,” analyst Philip Swift, who created the tool in 2019, explained at the time.
The March 2020 COVID-19 crash, for example, had marked Bitcoin’s longest recent trip below the 350DMA, but 2022 managed to beat it by three months to two.
As such, the first three months of this year look like a clear exception to the rule when it comes to GRM.
Another use for GRM is naturally tied to predicting Bitcoin market cycle tops. In 2019, Swift estimated that the next top would be roughly three times the 350DMA.
“If this decreasing Fibonacci sequence pattern continues to play out as it has done over the course of the past 9 years, then the next market cycle high will be when price is in the area of the 350DMA x3,” he reasoned.

Weekly chart makes mincemeat of once-solid resistance
On mid-range timeframes, as Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin is already making a statement when it comes to trendlines in place throughout 2022.

Two MAs providing resistance in Q1 — the 21-week and 50-week exponential MA — saw their first challenge this week, and bulls are currently battling for them as new support, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.
The two roughly divide Bitcoin’s current trading range, in effect since the start of 2021, into two parts with $28,000 and $69,000 as the floor and ceiling, respectively.
Moving above them, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital previously said, would allow BTC/USD to have a shot at new all-time highs.
“BTC has performed a Weekly Candle Close above the 21-week Bull Market EMA when price is in an uptrend for the first time since mid-July 2021,” he added in an update on the topic this week.

Analysis of the wallet related to blockchain protocol Terra reveals that since it began amassing BTC in Q1 this year, it is up $165 million.
Terra co-founder rejects idea LFG moved BTC price
The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a nonprofit organization around Terra, is currently following through on its plans to back its new TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin with both Bitcoin and its native LUNA token.
The plans were only revealed this month by Terra co-founder Do Kwon, but the destination wallet for the funds has been active longer and saw a significant inflow back in January.
Since mid-March, buying has accelerated, and in just a few short weeks, LFG’s balance has passed 30,000 BTC.
If that weren’t impressive enough, Bitcoin’s bull run, whether associated or not with Terra’s purchases, has netted the organization $165 million in circumstantial profits. At this week’s three-month highs above $48,000, the tally hit $186 million.

Countering criticism of Terra’s plans by gold bug Peter Schiff, meanwhile, Kwon appeared to deny the idea that such a large-volume investment run could produce BTC price upside.

_I_ am not buying bitcoin, the reserve is for the communities of users that use UST - numbering in the millions
Everyone should know. — Do Kwon (@stablekwon) March 30, 2022
“If I was capable of moving btc it would not be fit as a reserve asset,” he wrote as part of a Twitter debate with Schiff Thursday.
Schiff had argued that the aim of backing a United States dollar stablecoin with anything other than USD “makes no sense.”
Terra to Tesla: “Hold my beer”
As Cointelegraph reported, Terra plans to buy a total of $10 billion worth of BTC.

This would make its holdings dwarf those of other well-known “whale” entities, including MicroStrategy, which currently has the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin treasury of 125,051 BTC ($5.89 billion).
While MicroStrategy plans to keep buying, there has been no such commitment from runner-up Tesla, which holds an estimated 43,200 BTC.
LFG, it would appear, will soon outpace it.

Shiba Inu, the meme-coin project that mimicked dogecoin, has announced it is launching its own take on the metaverse. The project, called “Shib: The Metaverse,” will introduce more than 100K plots of land to be unlocked at different times. The Shiba Inu team also announced the prices of the plots, which depend on their location, detailing that they will be sold for ether instead of the metaverse’s native token.
Shiba Inu to Launch Puppy Metaverse
Shiba Inu, one of the meme-tokens launched mimicking the idea of dogecoin, the first meme-coin, has now announced the development of its own metaverse initiative. The project, which is called “Shib: The Metaverse,” will have direct integration with Shiboshis, a series of NFTs the project issued before. The team specified that this project would be developed by a yet-unnamed third-party game studio.
According to an announcement issued by the project team:
Shib : The Metaverse is the culmination of our history as a community, virtually displayed, in a layer of beautiful visuals that showcase our innovation and unity with a place to truly call home.
Furthermore, the announcement declares that all of the tokens in the Shiba Inu environment will play an important role in the metaverse, and that the community will have a “great deal of interaction” in this virtual environment.
Land Plots and Prices
“Shib: The Metaverse” aims to have one of the biggest land maps when compared with similar projects. The team confirmed that more than 100K land plots will be created, with these able to be leveraged for more than just decoration. While there was no explanation of the way in which these plots will be monetized, the Shiba Inu development team stated:
Users who own land in Shib: The Metaverse will be able to generate passive income, gather in-game resources, and generate rewards.
A part of these plots will be kept by the team to be used as common grounds needed for players to move across the map of the metaverse. Each one of these plots will have a different price depending on the tiers of the metaverse in which the plot is grouped.
The prices of the land plots were announced in ether instead of in SHIB, the native token of the project, a decision that the team had to explain. On this issue, they stated:
As we will use the collected funds to pay for the Metaverse development, the team have decided to use a neutral coin that can be sold into stablecoins in order to pay all the sources.

236,2022-04-02,2022-04-02,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Emmanuel Awosika,bitcoinmagazine.com,Building Applications On The Bitcoin Network,It is possible to build on the Bitcoin blockchain using layer two technologies while leveraging the security and censorship-resistance it provides.,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/building-applications-on-the-bitcoin-network,"For years, Ethereum has been the darling of the developer community. As decentralized applications (DApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded on the Ethereum network, Bitcoin struggled to match its popularity for this purpose.
It’s easy to see why developers preferred Ethereum to Bitcoin for building solutions. The network’s higher throughput and Turing completeness meant that complex applications could be built and executed seamlessly.
However, as Bob Dylan put it, “The times they are a-changin.”
Thanks to massive advances in technology, building on Bitcoin has become easier than ever and developers can enjoy all the benefits of the Bitcoin network: censorship-resistance, access to liquidity and enormous network effects.
We’ll look into the basics of building on the Bitcoin blockchain and explore some of the best examples of Bitcoin-based applications.
What Are The Challenges Of Building On Bitcoin?
Compared to new-generation blockchain platforms like Cardano, Ethereum or Solana, Bitcoin was never intended to host applications on its base layer. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, simply envisioned it as a censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer method of settling payments.
Bitcoin’s core architecture is as simple as it gets, which makes building anything on it difficult, at least until now. For instance, Bitcoin uses a Turing incomplete system, which is different from Turing complete systems found in most blockchains today.
Without getting overly technical, Turing completeness is a concept that denotes a machine’s ability to solve complex computations. According to Alan Turing, who propounded the theory, a Turing complete machine is one that can handle any task, irrespective of the complexity — provided it has time, memory and correct instructions.
Bitcoin was deliberately scripted with Turing incomplete language. Why? Because it keeps Bitcoin’s functionality simple. Besides, increased complexity introduces more vulnerabilities and problems, as any programmer knows.
Ethereum uses a Turing-complete scripting language, meaning it can be adapted to different uses. That’s why developers have been able to program the Ethereum blockchain to serve different purposes, such as running smart contracts.
Another problem with Bitcoin development is the low throughput of the base layer. While the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism Bitcoin uses guarantees security, decentralization and immutability, it reduces the number of transactions that can happen on the blockchain.
Currently, Bitcoin processes around five to seven transactions per second, partly due to limits on its block size. This is low compared to the thousands which centralized payment systems like VisaNet can process in the same timeframe.
These constraints have collectively made Bitcoin development difficult, such that many developers forego the blockchain for newer platforms. However, these platforms cannot match Bitcoin’s security, decentralization and acceptance — creating even more problems for projects built on any other blockchain.
One solution would be to create a system that benefits from Bitcoin’s qualities, but extends the functionality of the base layer. This has been a preoccupation for many in the Bitcoin community for years, and now the efforts are starting to bear fruit.
Can You Build On The Bitcoin Blockchain?
The short answer is, “Yes, you can build on top of Bitcoin.” The longer answer is what we’re about to discuss in the next section of this article.
Unless a radical change happens, Bitcoin’s base layer won’t change to allow for the development of complex applications. Given the Bitcoin community’s cautious approach to upgrades, we can expect this to be the case for a while.
Rather, building on the Bitcoin blockchain is possible by employing scaling solutions that aim to improve the system’s scalability and functionality. Also called Layer 2 technologies, scaling solutions abstract some tasks away from the base layer, but depend on it for security and immutability.
Let’s look at some of the Layer 2 solutions for building on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Lightning Network
Lightning Network is the most popular solution for scaling Bitcoin-based applications. The core idea behind Lightning Network’s design is that small transactions don’t need to be recorded on the blockchain.
Lightning allows individuals to conduct transactions off-chain, boosting system throughput. However, the final state of these transactions are recorded on the blockchain to ensure security and immutability.
Here’s a simple and popular explanation for how the Lightning Network functions:
Imagine you have to buy coffee from Joe’s shop downtown. You want to pay with bitcoin, but network fees and long confirmation times make it impractical.
With the Lightning Network, you can open a “channel” between you and Joe to process the payment. The payment channel connects your wallet address with Joe’s, so you can pay for your coffee. Since this transaction happens off the main Bitcoin blockchain, payments are seamless and cheaper.
When the transaction ends, both parties can agree to close the channel and have the final state recorded on the blockchain. Once this happens, all the funds in the channel are automatically transferred to Joe — think of a payment channel as a smart contract.
Recording final transaction states on the main blockchain guarantees security. Besides, multiple transactions are bundled together for confirmation, reducing the number of unconfirmed transactions clogging up the network.
The Lightning Network has many use cases, especially in building applications. Examples of apps built with Lightning Network include micropayment platforms like Tipping.me, a browser extension that allows users to tip others on Twitter.
Another popular application built with Lightning Network is LightNite, a multiplayer battle-royale game similar to Fortnite. LightNite is, however, a play-to-earn game that rewards players with bitcoin based on their performance.
Other Bitcoin-based applications running on the Lightning Network include Strike, Sphinx, Bitrefill, and LN.Pizza.
Rootstock
Rootstock (RSK) is a Layer 2 solution for building smart contracts that can run on Bitcoin. The RSK blockchain connects to the Bitcoin blockchain via a two-way peg. Those familiar with sidechains will understand how Rootstock manages to interact with Bitcoin.
The Rootstock Virtual Machine (RVM) is similar to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which facilitates the execution of smart contracts. Crucially, Rootstock’s VM is Turing complete, so developers can program complex logic into applications like they can with Ethereum.
Rootstock can tap into Bitcoin’s security because of merge mining. It can also promote faster transactions through off-chain solutions. According to estimates, the Rootstock blockchain may be able to handle up to 100 transactions per second, which is way higher than Bitcoin’s current throughput.
Stacks
Stacks differs from the other solutions on this list, as it’s not a Layer 2 scaling solution. Rather, it is a Layer 1 blockchain connected to Bitcoin by its consensus mechanism, called proof-of-transfer (PoX).
Stacks relies on Bitcoin’s secure, open and permissionless structure, but adds never-before-seen capabilities like NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts.
With Stacks, you can build on Bitcoin without changing the base layer. All transactions conducted on Stacks or Stacks-based applications are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, boosting Stack’s security. Stacks applications can interact with the Bitcoin blockchain, so users can transact using bitcoin.
Stacks is useful for building NFT marketplaces, DeFi apps, wallets, and social networks. You can see this list for all Bitcoin-based applications built with Stacks. If you want an in-depth description of Stacks, read this article from the Stacks Foundation.
The Benefits Of Building On Bitcoin
If you’ve read the article up until this point, then you may be asking: “Why should I build on Bitcoin?”
It turns out that you do have many reasons to consider running apps on the Bitcoin blockchain.
First, you should consider the network effects of Bitcoin. In economics, the term “network effects” refers to a situation whereby a product acquires higher value as its user base grows.
This article does a good job of explaining the mechanics of Bitcoin’s network effects and the implications for its market dominance. However, here’s a TL;DR version if you’re too busy to read:
Bitcoin is the most popular blockchain and has the highest market capitalization of any cryptocurrency on the market. With Bitcoin adoption expected to keep growing at an exponential rate, it makes financial sense to build services for Bitcoin users.
Most holders have chosen to convert their bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies to interact with smart contracts and DApps on other platforms. Developers can easily tap into this enormous market by making it possible to use DApps, NFTs, DeFi marketplaces and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Another critical reason to run DApps on Bitcoin is the security it affords users. Though considered clunky and computing-intensive, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is undoubtedly the hardest to breach.
To take over the Bitcoin blockchain, hackers would need to control 51% of all nodes in the network. While this isn’t outright impossible, the exploit would require an enormous amount of resources and time to succeed. And there aren’t that many hackers out there ready to make that kind of investment, so we can rule out the possibility of a Bitcoin hack.
Summing Up
Although Bitcoin isn’t traditionally suited to running complex applications, newer solutions make it easy for developers to run DApps on the platform. These applications can take advantage of Bitcoin’s impressive security and network effects. With such innovations, Bitcoin can give Ethereum’s applications a run for the money and extend its long-term viability."

On Thursday, the investment firm Vaneck published a blog post that calculates how much gold or bitcoin would be worth if the two assets became global reserve assets. Vaneck’s report explained that the investment team “attempted to quantify the emergence of new gold or bitcoin-backed currency regimes.” The study’s calculations estimate that gold could reach $31,000 per ounce and bitcoin could potentially hit $1.3 million per coin. If the assets became M2 monetary supplies, then the values of bitcoin and gold could be much higher.
Vaneck’s Investment Team Calculates ‘Extreme’ Scenarios Where Gold or Bitcoin Obtain Global Reserve Status
Executives from Vaneck’s emerging markets (EM) bond investment team, Eric Fine and Natalia Gurushina, published a report on March 30, 2022, that touches on “extreme scenarios” where gold or bitcoin theoretically become M0 or M2 money supplies. While a monetary base (M0 or narrow money) equates to all the physical currency and coins, M2 measures both cash and checking deposits and broad money as well.
Vaneck’s Insights blog post says “money has changed,” and highlights the recent sanctions against Russia which froze the country’s USD, EUR, and JPY fiat reserves. Fine and Gurushina write that Vaneck’s EM bond investment team thinks the world’s central banks “will act, as will private individual actors.” The team attempts to quantify the emergence of gold and bitcoin-backed regimes and after the calculations, both estimates are quite substantial in terms of price value.
“We built a simple framework to value gold and bitcoin. For gold, we divide global money supply (M0 and M2) by global gold reserves,” the Vaneck EM bond investment team blog post explains. “The money liability is divided by the reserve asset. We used current reserve holdings in troy ounces for gold, and we used the current exchange rate to convert the monetary base liability into U.S. dollars.”
The EM bond investment team explains that the implied global price for gold using M0 “divided by global gold reserves, for countries with the largest gold holdings is $31,000 per ounce (average) and $21,000 per ounce (median).” Additionally, the implied global price for gold using M2 data divided by global gold reserves is “around $105,000 per ounce,” Vaneck’s report notes.
Implied Price of Bitcoin Using Global M2 Is $4.8 Million per Coin
Vaneck’s team did the same calculations for bitcoin (BTC), in contrast to cryptocurrencies, because the potential supply of crypto is infinite while BTC has a 21 million coin supply cap. The report notes that the upside would be higher with bitcoin (33x) than gold (16x). “The implied price of bitcoin using the same aggregate M0 that we used for gold is around $1,300,000 per coin,” the authors noted in the report. Vaneck’s “extreme” scenario calculations further estimate:
The implied price of bitcoin using global M2 is $4,800,000 per coin.
The report’s authors stress that the circumstances required for this to happen would be an unusual event and “assumptions [are based] on the probability of that ‘extreme’ scenario occurring, or on the portion bitcoin will be fulfilling in any new reserve status,” Vaneck’s report states. At the end of Vaneck’s Insights blog post, the authors say that something big has happened, and they are attempting to quantify the impact.
“‘Stories’ about the future of money are interesting, but if one agrees that this is a potentially new paradigm, an attempt at quantification is needed,” Vaneck’s report concludes. “That was our intent with this exercise – to be as specific as possible about a nebulous and complicated issue. The key asset-price implication of the big change is significant upside in gold and bitcoin.”

238,2022-04-02,2022-04-02,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Guest Author,cointelegraph.com,Indonesia’s cryptocurrency community in 2022: An overview,"With Indonesia’s burgeoning crypto community and already vibrant artistic scene, NFTs might be the latest chapter in Indonesia’s crypto journey.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/indonesia-s-cryptocurrency-community-in-2022-an-overview,"Crypto is the next big thing in Indonesia. According to the Ministry of Trade, transactions for currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) grew over 14 times from a total of 60 trillion rupiahs ($4.1 billion) in 2020 to a total of 859 trillion rupiahs ($59.83 billion) in 2021.
It’s getting to the point where crypto is becoming more popular than traditional stock. Vice Minister of Trade Jerry Sambuaga stated that more than 11 million Indonesians bought or sold crypto in 2021. In comparison, according to the Indonesian Central Securities Depository, the total number of portfolio investors — indicated by the number of single investor identities — reached 7.35 million in 2021.
Even so, 11 million crypto investors is still only about 4% of Indonesia’s total population, meaning there’s still plenty of room to grow. The crypto community’s growth in Indonesia goes hand-in-hand with several supporting local phenomena, including but not limited to:
Regulatory support from government bodies
Increased ease of access to cryptocurrency trading
Adoption from major local tech players
Regulators aim to make things more secure
Although crypto assets are still not permitted as payment instruments, companies are welcome to buy and sell crypto as trading commodities in Indonesia. Since 2019, cryptocurrency trading in Indonesia has been officially overseen and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI), a body under the Ministry of Trade.
This governing body is, among other things, in charge of vetting, documenting and approving companies and commodity items allowed to be traded in Indonesia. As of 2021, its whitelist of permitted crypto tokens reached 229 items, including popular assets such as Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA).
These items are permitted based on BAPPEBTI’s own vetting methods, considering market capitalization rankings as well as security, background checks on the development teams, blockchain system management, and development roadmaps with verifiable success metrics.
In an official statement, the governing body iterated its main objective of providing legal security and protecting the interests of Indonesian crypto consumers. BAPPEBTI stated:
“With the new rules that we had published, it is hoped that we and crypto exchanges in Indonesia could work together to help ensure that every crypto transaction is legally regulated and safe for investors in Indonesia.”
Another governing body, the Financial Service Authority, has specifically prohibited financial service companies, such as lending or credit services, from marketing or facilitating crypto trading, reiterating BAPPEBTI’s regulation that all crypto exchanges must be specifically registered with them.
The aforementioned boom in the number of both crypto and stock investors in Indonesia goes hand-in-hand with the rising popularity of fintech apps, such as Bareksa and Ajaib, meaning that a large portion of these new investors might be novices. Tokocrypto, a prominent local crypto exchange, has stated its intent to work together with the government to make trading more secure by helping educate investors about the risks of crypto trading and how to avoid legally dubious exchanges and assets.
Companies that plan to boost crypto adoption in Indonesia would need to build an active and positive working relationship with the government and ensure compliance with all of its regulations to gain local consumers’ trust.
17 registered crypto exchanges in Indonesia
Until March 2022, there have been 17 companies registered and permitted by BAPPEBTI to exchange cryptocurrencies in Indonesia, with their userbases rapidly increasing. A market leader, Indodax reported reaching 5 million members in 2022, a 104% increase compared to 2021. Another prominent exchange, Tokocrypto, had reported reaching 2 million members by the end of 2021, an eightfold increase compared to 2020.
As mentioned above, a large contributing factor to these platforms’ success is their mobile-first strategy, with easily accessible apps. With Indonesia’s internet penetration standing at 73.7% in 2021, it’s no wonder that there’s more traction from the country’s mobile-heavy user base.
Indonesia’s crypto community is also growing beyond just exchanges. The Indonesia Blockchain Association, a local consortium and advocacy group for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, has 28 member companies and organizations as of 2022. The association comprises not only exchanges but also startups and tech companies using blockchain in their ecosystem and media platforms specializing in crypto.
Steven Suhadi, co-founder of Indonesia Crypto Network and founding member of the Indonesia Blockchain Association, told Cointelegraph, “Regulators in Indonesia over the past 10 years have become adaptable to technological changes, from e-commerce to ride-hailing and, most recently, P2P [peer-to-peer] lending. Indonesia has clearly-defined rules for exchanges and crypto trading already. Over the last 24 months, regulators have taken more proactive steps for digital assets, which will help to proliferate Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in Indonesia.”
More supply means more demand, and with more players entering the country, the stage is set for another boost in crypto’s popularity.
Local tech leaders welcome crypto with open arms
In December 2021, crypto exchange Binance announced a joint venture with a consortium led by MDI Ventures to develop a new digital asset exchange in Indonesia.
MDI is the $830-million venture capital arm of Indonesia’s largest telecommunications company, Telkom Indonesia. MDI’s portfolio boasts several companies that have gone on to become household names in Indonesia, including financial technology leaders Kredivo and KoinWorks.
Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao has expressed his confidence and objectives regarding crypto in Indonesia, stating, “With fast technology adoption and strong economic potential, Indonesia could become one of the leading centers of the blockchain and crypto ecosystem in Southeast Asia.”
This sentiment was repeated by MDI CEO Donald Wihardja, who stated, “Cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, and the underlying technology, blockchain, present an undeniably important part of the financial and other digital infrastructures in the future.”
It’ll be worth keeping a close eye on this partnership in the future, but right now, it can be considered a sign that crypto is no longer a niche market in Indonesia. More mainstream players have started moving into it, which could mean more resources and momentum to increase adoption.
What’s next for Indonesia?
With the rising trend in transaction volume and the number of traders as well as exchanges in recent years, we can assume that crypto and blockchain will only get bigger in 2022 and beyond. Nonfungible tokens (NFT) recently stepped into the spotlight in Indonesia after news broke about Ghozali, a computer science student who made over $1 million from selling NFT selfies on OpenSea. With Indonesia’s burgeoning crypto community and already vibrant artistic scene, NFTs might be the latest chapter in Indonesia’s crypto journey — either way, it’s become an emerging market to watch out for.

The head of Defiance ETFs says she is “completely bullish on bitcoin.” Noting that it is a “good time” to get into the cryptocurrency, she explained why she believes the price of bitcoin will reach $100K.
CEO of Defiance ETFs Bullish on Bitcoin
Sylvia Jablonski, chief executive officer, chief investment officer, and co-founder of Defiance ETFs, explained her bullishness on bitcoin despite recent price declines in an interview with CNBC Thursday.
Defiance ETFs is an exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sponsor and registered investment advisor focused on thematic investing.
Jablonski told the media outlet:
I remain completely bullish on bitcoin. I think the short-term activity is just noise.
She noted: “It looks as though, in terms of what we’ve seen for the last six months to a year or so, is that bitcoin is correlated with risk assets and equities specifically.”
The executive explained that when investors see the crypto market rallying for a couple of days, they pile back into bitcoin, ether, and some of the other cryptocurrencies. Similarly, “when you do see pullbacks, they seem to be hitting bitcoin too,” she pointed out.
Regarding bitcoin as an inflation hedge, she admitted that “a couple of years ago, a lot of us thought that bitcoin was going to be this great inflation hedge and it was going to react in a similar way to gold and it was going to be this safe-haven inflation trade, but I think it’s trading more like a Nasdaq 100 stock than it is like an inflation trade.”
Jablonski predicted, “In the short term it’s going to be sideways volatility, it’s going to be range-bound price action, but longer-term, I still expect bitcoin to be in that $100,000 camp before I expect it to go to zero.” The Defiance ETFs boss elaborated:
I still think it’s kind of a good time to get in.
Jablonski described: “We have to think about it as we do the market so if I think about what happened with some of the broad-based indices, and again just using Nasdaq as an example, at one point we hit 200-day moving average and Nasdaq was very much in bear market territory, 20% or more below all-time highs.”
She emphasized:
Bitcoin mirrored that, and here we are getting off that 200-day average on Nasdaq and we are getting off our lows on bitcoin as well.
“So I think that we definitely have a tradable bottom. I think we are going to have these short-term rallies, but I don’t think that this is it. I think that the market has a little more to weather in terms of range-bound volatility. There’s a psychological aspect to the headwinds as well,” she further shared.
The executive continued: “You have [the] Russia-Ukraine [war], you have inflation, you have the Fed raising rates, and that just keeps investors holding on to their cash, which is actually a huge mistake in the end because that locks in losses.”
Jablonski added: “But I think once they kind of get past that psychological aspect and we sort of see the fundamentals in the economy and cryptocurrency and bitcoin, you’ll start to see it rally so I don’t think we’re going to get that straight shot just yet.” She opined:
I think you’ll get some range-bound volatility now between $46,000, $47,000, and $50,000. I think kind of down the road we’ll see that rally up to $100,000.
At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $46,075 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.

""If they only knew the magnitude of what’s to come,"" Samson Mow, formerly the chief strategy officer at bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream who left the company last month to focus on ""nation-state bitcoin adoption,"" posted to Twitter in response to an article warning that El Salvador's ""bitcoin gamble is crumbling.""
Mow added El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele, Jack Mallers, the chief executive of El Salvador bitcoin payments partner Strike, and bitcoin writer Allen Farrington ""are all trying to outdo each other for big surprises"" at the Bitcoin 2022 conference which kicks off on Wednesday and runs through until Saturday.
El Salvador last week postponed its controversial $1 billion bitcoin-backed bond, with bitcoin billionaire Michael Saylor, who's speaking at the event, warning the market perhaps isn't ""quite ready"" for bitcoin bonds.
Bukele will also be speaking at the conference next week, with the event attracting big-name headliners such as PayPal cofounder and tech investor Peter Thiel and psychologist Jordon Peterson. Last year, Peterson began to show interest in bitcoin, interviewing The Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Amous.
Odell Beckham Jr, an NFL player who made headlines when he said he'd take part of his salary in bitcoin and has become an outspoken ambassador for the cryptocurrency, and Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector and human rights activist, are also speaking at the Miami bitcoin conference.
Last year, the Miami bitcoin conference was hailed as the largest bitcoin event in the world with bitcoin's huge price explosion just months earlier fueling unprecedented interest in cryptocurrency.

The bitcoin price had surpassed its previous all-time in late 2020, soaring to highs of $60,000 shortly after the conference in which Bukele announced a bill to make bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador and Jack Dorsey, who was then still chief executive of Twitter, told conference attendees that ""if I were not at Square or Twitter, I would be working on bitcoin.""

Earlier this year, Mow named Mexico as ""on the list"" of countries that could follow El Salvador into bitcoin. ""I'm working with people from a number of countries and it's still too early to say for sure but bitcoin adoption in some form will be inevitable,"" Mow said at the time.
In January, Wall Street giant Fidelity predicted other countries and even a central bank could follow El Salvador into bitcoin this year—saying that those who buy bitcoin while the price is low ""will be better off competitively than their peers.""
""There is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers,"" Fidelity analysts Chris Kuiper and Jack Neureuter wrote in a note, adding they ""wouldn't be surprised to see other sovereign nation-states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition."""

JPMorgan Chase & Co. has warned that any upside for crypto markets from here would likely be more limited. Basing their prediction on the relationship between stablecoins and the rest of the crypto market, the bank’s analyst explained that stablecoins’ share of the total crypto market cap “no longer looks excessive.”
JPMorgan’s Crypto Outlook
Global investment bank JPMorgan reportedly warned about cryptocurrency markets having limited upside in a note published last week.
JPMorgan sees stablecoins’ share of the total cryptocurrency market value as an indicator of potential for rallies or declines. Previously, when stablecoins accounted for almost 10% of the total crypto market cap, JPMorgan analyst Panigirtzoglou said it “pointed to further upside for crypto markets.”
In the note issued last week, he explained: “The share of stablecoins in total crypto market cap no longer looks excessive … This share currently stands below 7% which brings it back to its trend since 2020.” The JPMorgan analyst continued:
As a result we believe that any further upside for crypto markets from here would likely be more limited.
Panigirtzoglou pointed out that the price of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rallied in early March following financial sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries after its invasion of Ukraine.
The note describes: “These sanctions had raised expectations that cryptocurrencies will be used more extensively in the future to circumvent the traditional banking system given cryptocurrencies are not attached or depend on any government.”
However, citing the stablecoin share indicator, the JPMorgan analyst warned that the rallies seen in crypto markets may be coming to an end.
In February, JPMorgan predicted that the long-term price of bitcoin would reach $150,000. In January, the bank conducted a client survey and found that the majority of respondents expected the price of BTC to reach $60,000 or more this year.
Unlike JPMorgan, several people have said they see a significant upside to the crypto market. The CEO of Defiance ETFs said she remains “completely bullish on bitcoin,” expecting the price of the cryptocurrency to reach $100,000. In addition, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, outlined a number of bullish factors affecting crypto markets last week.

A lawsuit against Binance accusing the cryptocurrency exchange of selling unregistered crypto securities has been dismissed. The plaintiffs listed nine cryptocurrencies in the lawsuit.
Binance’s Lawsuit Dismissed
U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter dismissed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Binance Thursday.
The motion to dismiss was filed by Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The lawsuit (case no. 20-02803) was originally filed in April 2020 in the U.S. district court in the Southern District of New York.
Binance is accused of violating U.S. securities laws by selling cryptocurrencies that are allegedly unregistered securities. The exchange is also accused of failing to register as a securities exchange or broker-dealer with U.S. regulators.
The case involves nine cryptocurrencies — EOS, QSP, KNC, TRX, FUN, ICX, OMG, LEND, and ELF — which the plaintiffs bought through Binance’s online exchange starting in 2017. However, the coins soon lost significant value.
The plaintiffs alleged that Binance “wrongfully engaged in millions of transactions” and failed to warn them about the “significant risks” of investing in these cryptocurrencies. They sought to recoup what they paid.
However, Judge Carter ruled that the plaintiffs sued Binance too late, citing that more than a year had passed between the time of their purchases and the time they filed the lawsuit.
In addition, the federal judge said that U.S. securities laws did not apply because Binance was not a U.S.-based exchange, even if it used Amazon computer servers in the U.S. He wrote:
Plaintiffs must allege more than stating that plaintiffs bought tokens while located in the U.S. and that title passed in whole or in part over servers located in California that host Binance’s website.
Binance was not the only cryptocurrency exchange recently sued for allegedly selling unregistered crypto securities. In March, three Coinbase users filed a class-action lawsuit against the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange, claiming that the platform sold 79 unregistered securities.
In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not actively stated which cryptocurrencies are securities. However, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said on several occasions that many of the cryptocurrencies listed on exchanges with 50 to 100 listings are likely securities.

244,2022-04-03,2022-04-03,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Tanaya Macheel,www.cnbc.com,A new stablecoin issuer is buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. What crypto investors need to know,"Here's what you need to know about UST, LUNA and why Terra is looking to bitcoin to diversify its reserves.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/03/a-new-stablecoin-issuer-is-buying-billions-of-dollars-in-bitcoin-what-crypto-investors-need-to-know.html,"This past week the price of bitcoin climbed above $48,000 for the first time since Dec. 31. In the same week, LUNA, the governance token behind the Ethereum alternative Terra, hit an all-time high. The moves have Terra's big bitcoin buying spree to thank, at least in part. The network has been buying bitcoin since January, and on a daily basis for the past two weeks. It has accumulated about $1.4 billion to date, with a goal of building a $3 billion reserve for its stablecoin, UST. The project's founder Do Kwon has also expressed interest in buying up to $10 billion over time for its reserves. ""This buying pressure has definitely helped the price of bitcoin, but the narrative has helped even more,"" said Arca chief investment officer Jeff Dorman. ""The fact that a large stablecoin producer is recognizing the importance of bitcoin as collateral, during a time where people all around the world are realizing their money isn't really their money – Canada citizens, Russian citizens, anyone in the SWIFT system, anyone with money on the London Metal Exchange – is a powerful bull thesis for bitcoin."" Terra has accumulated nearly 31,000 BTC to date , making it the third largest holder of bitcoin, behind MicroStrategy and Tesla. The two-year-old UST is also now the fourth largest stablecoin by market cap, behind Tether, USDC and the BUSD stablecoin founded by Paxos and Binance. ""UST is a decentralized stablecoin and it's backed by decentralized money,"" said Natalie Luu, head of ecosystem at Terraform Labs. ""We want to make sure UST is as trustless and permissionless as possible. Bitcoin is one of the currencies that maintains the reserve of UST, it's digital gold. By adding bitcoin the largest cryptocurrency in the world as a piece of this reserve, it just furthers our mission as being the largest decentralized money there is."" Here's what you need to know about UST, LUNA and why Terra is looking to bitcoin to diversify its reserves. Terra vs. LUNA Terra is a “layer 1” blockchain like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and others. They function as the security layer upon which developers can build decentralized applications, which give value to the base layer (in this case, Terra). Terraform Labs launched the Terra blockchain but doesn’t own it outright. Instead, everyone on the network, including Terraform labs, owns a piece of it by holding LUNA, the native token of this particular blockchain. The blockchain powers an ecosystem of real-world applications, Luu said. For example, the Korea-based payments app Chai uses stablecoins and is powered by Terra’s LUNA token. There are more than 100 recently created projects in development that Terraform Labs anticipates will launch over the next year, she added. The Terra stablecoin Terra was built to deploy a suite of algorithmic decentralized stablecoins, meaning it should be able to maintain their pegs using just software, without collateral. They haven’t taken off in crypto; efforts to date have been seen as too idealistic or too early. TerraUSD (UST) is by far the most popular one among the crypto community, according to Michael Rinko, venture associate at AscendEx. The critical issue with centralized stablecoins like Tether and USDC has to do with the composition of reserves. Stablecoin issuers like Tether in theory should have 100% reserves denominated in U.S. dollars on hand if every holder of the stablecoin should want to redeem it for dollars at once. In practice, a very small percentage of tethers reserves is in cash and the company has been famously mysterious about what it invests in. Circle, the company behind the stablecoin USDC, has revealed just 60% of its reserves are in cash . The UST peg Like many currencies, UST is pegged at a 1-to-1 ratio with the dollar. Arbitrage opportunities have been key to maintaining UST’s peg, and investors have taken opportunity of it for big profits, Rinko said. Users can always swap one LUNA for UST and vice versa at a guaranteed price of $1, regardless of the market price of either token at the time. If demand for UST rises and its price goes above $1, LUNA holders can earn risk-free profit by swapping $1 of LUNA to create one UST token, Rinko explained. In this case the UST token would be worth more than $1 and the user would make money on the spread. Similarly, if demand is low for UST and the price falls below $1, UST holders can exchange their UST tokens at a ratio of 1-to-1 for LUNA, which would be worth more because of their scarcity. “Although this arbitrage-based peg model sounds good in theory, and likely works in a perfect world, many worry about the possibility of a ‘bank run’ in a time of panic,” he said. “The Luna Foundation is trying to assuage these concerns by raising bitcoin to diversify their reserves and own assets that are considered less correlated to the Terra ecosystem. It may provide an additional avenue to maintain the peg in contractionary cycles that reduces the reflexivity of the system.”

247,2022-04-04,2022-04-02,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Stuart Williams,Afp,Jul,Agence France-Presse,Jun",www.al-monitor.com,Report: One third of Israelis and Emiratis own cryptocurrency,Both Israel and the UAE have emerged as centers of cryptocurrency in the Middle East.,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/04/report-one-third-israelis-and-emiratis-own-cryptocurrency,"April 4, 2022
A New York-based cryptocurrency exchange released a report today detailing cryptocurrency ownership in the Middle East.
Gemini published its first “Global state of crypto” report following what it said was a pivotal year for digital currencies. The exchange conducted a poll of people in various countries to determine worldwide rates of cryptocurrency ownership and related findings.
Gemini’s data indicated that 28% of people in Israel and 35% of people in the United Arab Emirates own cryptocurrency, according to the report. Israel and the UAE are the only Middle Eastern countries included in the study.
In Israel, 51% of the respondents who reported owning cryptocurrency are female. In the UAE, however, 68% are male, indicating a relative lack of crypto ownership among women in the Gulf state.
Gemini polled more than 1,200 people each in Israel and the Emirates.
Why it matters: Cryptocurrency is taking off in both Israel and the UAE. In March, Israel’s Bank Leumi became the first traditional bank in the country to allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Also last month, the Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Coinmama was bought out for assets totaling more than $35 million by Canada’s Wellfield Technologies. Coinmama has more than 3.5 million users.
In the UAE, two major crypto platforms — Bybit and Crypto.com — announced in March they will soon open offices in Dubai.
The growth of cryptocurrency in Israel has been aided by increased venture capital investment in blockchain technology, according to Gemini.
What’s next: Looming government regulation could be a barrier to cryptocurrency’s future growth in Israel and the UAE. Gemini said that 30% of the people they polled in the countries said tax complexities have stopped them from investing in the currency.
Israeli authorities have openly said they want the market to be more regulated, and the crypto exchange Binance was recently suspended in the country, Al-Monitor reported.
The UAE may be poised for more growth despite potential regulatory uncertainty. Gemini’s poll found that 32% of non-owners in the country are likely to purchase some cryptocurrency this year."
248,2022-04-04,2022-04-04,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,bitcoinmagazine.com,"Intel Launches New Bitcoin Mining Chip, Blockscale","Intel’s new bitcoin mining chip, the Intel Blockscale ASIC, will ship in Q3 2022 to select customers.",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/intel-launches-new-bitcoin-mining-chip-blockscale,"Intel has announced details for its upcoming bitcoin mining chip, the Intel Blockscale ASIC, which will ship in Q3 2022.
Intel’s chip, focused on energy efficiency and sustainability, will operate with up to 26 J/TH of power efficiency.
The chipmaker will supply customers with only the ASIC ship itself, instead of shipping a fully-fledged mining system as currently common in the industry.
Intel today announced details for its new bitcoin mining chip, the Intel Blockscale ASIC, which seeks to increase energy efficiency of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining through the company’s decades of research and development in related areas, as per a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
“The Intel Blockscale ASIC is going to play a major role in helping bitcoin mining companies achieve both sustainability and hash rate scaling objectives in the years ahead,” said Jose Rios, general manager of Blockchain and Business Solutions in the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group at Intel.
Intel will provide its customers with only the ASIC chip itself, instead of delivering a complete ASIC mining system as is currently common in the industry.
Each Blockscale ASIC chip will deliver up to 580 gigahashes per second (GH/s) of hash rate with up to 26 joules per terahash (J/TH) of power efficiency and support up to 256 integrated circuits per chain, in addition to featuring on-chip temperature– and voltage–sensing capabilities.
Therefore, a mining system consisted of 256 Intel Blockscale ASIC chips would supposedly output roughly 148 TH/s and consume about 3,860 watts (W) of power. The flagship air-cooled mining system of the current global market leader, Bitmain, outputs 140 TH/s with an energy consumption of 3010 W, resulting in 21.5 J/TH of power efficiency.
The bitcoin mining industry suffers from insufficient ASIC supply due to the current global chip shortage. More than to compete head-to-head with current market leaders and seek to provide a more energy efficient offering, Intel will arguably add value to the industry in the short to medium term by increasing availability of miners. As constraints are reduced, long-term competition will then move towards performance and cost of ownership.
Intel’s shipments will also include a reference hardware design and software stack to jump-start customers’ system development. Argo Blockchain, Block, Inc., Hive Blockchain and GRIID Infrastructure are among the first mining companies to get their hands on Intel’s upcoming chip, which will begin shipping in Q3 2022. Intel said it will work with and supply prospective customers who share the company’s sustainability goals starting in 2023.
Intel made the headlines in January as it scheduled a presentation at ISSCC conference about an “ultra-low-voltage energy-efficient bitcoin mining ASIC.” The panel featured Intel’s past ASIC explorations, and in the same month the company shared that its new chip, the Blockscale ASIC, would ship this year."

Shareholders will have the option to get paid in either bitcoin or cash, the miner said in a statement on Monday.
The rest of Digihost’s net income will be reinvested to fund future business requirements and opportunities.
“The Board of Directors of Digihost is pleased to announce our decision to become the first public company in the crypto mining space to implement a dividend policy payable in BTC to its shareholders,” said CEO and chairman Michel Amar in the statement.
The decision comes as publicly traded miners are looking to diversify their business model to create additional shareholder value, rather than just holding onto their bitcoins in their balance sheet.
For 2022, the company said it expects an average hashrate of 1.5 exahash per second (EH/s), which is about a 5.5 times increase compared to its 2021 average hashrate. Currently, the miner's hashrate is 1 EH/s and it mines 4.25 bitcoins per day.
The miner also said it mined 186.8 bitcoin in the first quarter, an increase of about 78% from the same time period last year."
250,2022-04-05,2022-04-05,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,bitcoinmagazine.com,How Bitcoin Taro Protocol Works,"Taro, a new protocol proposed by Lightning Labs, leverages Taproot and the Lightning Network to bring new assets and scalability to Bitcoin.",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-bitcoin-taro-protocol-works,"Lightning Labs has introduced a new protocol proposal for Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, Taro, which seeks to bring new use cases to the network. The company has published a series of draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and it is asking for community feedback on the proposed design.
Taro seeks to enable the issuance of assets and collectibles, which are the protocol’s form of non-fungible assets, on Bitcoin as well as their transfer on Lightning in a private and secure manner without bloating the blockchain. To do so, it plans to leverage the protocol’s latest upgrade, Taproot.
“The design principles of Taro on Lightning draw from that of the internet, where you have complexity at the edges, but you keep the simplicity in between,” Elizabeth Stark, Lightning Labs CEO, told Bitcoin Magazine.
Most existing ways to issue and use assets on Bitcoin today either leverage another blockchain entirely, which adds a new trust model with different security assurances, or rely on adding extra data directly on-chain, which is inefficient for keeping track of asset information long term and is dangerous to user privacy.
Instead, Taro uses Taproot.
The Future Of Taproot: Scalability And Privacy
Taproot allows complex spending conditions to be set for a Bitcoin UTXO while ensuring that only the condition that ultimately gets used to spend the coin is revealed on-chain to all Bitcoin users. As a result, such a spend is more private, because a passive observer can’t tell if there were other spending conditions for that transaction; and more scalable, because now that complex scheme puts considerably less data on chain. This is meaningful because previous programmatic behaviors in Bitcoin meant transactions had to be revealed in their entirety whenever they were spent, hurting user privacy and making very complex schemes unfeasible due to a linear growth in storage needs.
By using Taproot, Taro can also rely on Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism for ensuring the correct ordering of transactions and preventing double spends, while defining special directives as to how to interact with and validate the new asset data.
As a result, Taro also differs from other asset solutions on “highly programmable” blockchains, such as Ethereum’s ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, because it is based on Bitcoin’s UTXO model instead of an account model, meaning that it is both more secure due to avoidance of key reuse and more private as there isn’t information about balances revealed. Taro’s approach is also more scalable and is compatible with light clients.
More specifically, Taro brings assets to Bitcoin through the “leaves” of the Taproot script tree, as each leaf in the tree is completely independent and can be selectively revealed — which enables structured commitment. By adding information about those assets (known as metadata) in the Taproot script tree, the proposed protocol can function as a layer built on top of Bitcoin, allowing Taro asset transactions to look like regular Bitcoin transactions, as on-chain only the Taproot output is revealed, while still enabling proofs of the movement of assets across the transaction graph.
Bitcoin Is Scalable
“This is pretty elegant because it lets you separate these asset commitments from the actual script itself,” Lightning Labs CTO, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, told Bitcoin Magazine. “Taproot, in this case, allows us to logically separate what is the main Bitcoin scripting layer from the asset layer itself. Even though they’re actually within the same output, because the Bitcoin layer doesn’t care about what isn’t revealed, we can use that to have additional structured data.”
As a result, this construction enables a single Taproot UTXO to effectively commit to (that is, include the hash of) an unbounded number of assets that are only revealed to the specific parties that need that information — without burdening the entire Bitcoin network.
“It makes things a little bit simpler and also makes it a lot easier for developers to understand because the overlay layer basically looks and feels like Bitcoin with some slight tweaks, additional commitments, validation, things like that,” Osuntokun said.
By leveraging Taproot for asset issuance and transfer, Taro effectively enables new functionality at the edges of Bitcoin by leveraging bitcoin liquidity as the asset gets routed through the Lightning Network, all without adding unnecessary data on chain.
“If people are doing more transactions at the edges using these assets, well, that means we actually need more capacity in the Lightning Network itself,” Osuntokun said. “Demand for assets at the edges, as far as structural capacity, then translate into increased productive activity on the network and more routing fees, so a greater network effect as well.”
As a result, Taro can take one step in the direction of increasing the demand for blockspace on chain, helping ensure that Bitcoin can keep sustainable once miners begin being paid only through transaction fees as the block subsidy nears zero in the next century.

Taro leverages a data structure known as a Merkle-Sum Sparse Merkle tree (MS-SMT) to enable assets to commit to Taproot script trees, acting as an overlay protocol. MS-SMT joins together properties of a regular Merkle tree, a Merkle-Sum tree, and a Sparse Merkle tree.
A Merkle tree is constructed by hashing a list of items’ hashes in pairs until we arrive at a single hash, called the root hash. For example, in a list of four items, we would first separately hash each item. Next, we would join the hashes of items one and two together and hash that concatenation, and do the same with the hashes of three and four. Lastly, we would hash the remaining two hashes to determine the root hash.
A Merkle tree is useful because it can store lots of data, it makes it easy to prove that some data exists in the tree, and it also allows us to check that data hasn’t been tampered with. In other words, a regular Merkle tree enables scalability, proof of membership and tamper resistance.
Moreover, we only need to store the root hash of the Merkle tree on chain to verify such properties. That’s because if the data in one leaf is tampered with, for example, its hash would also change, further changing all of the hashes at levels above it which would lastly change the root hash — which can have its change attested through comparison to the stored version.
The Merkle-Sum tree takes this one step further by allowing us to commit to the sum of all leaf values, meaning its root hash can also include information about the sum of the values of each leaf in the tree. In the context of assets, this property enables an asset’s supply to be more easily audited, as well as allowing the divisibility of the asset and preventing undesired issuance of new assets in transactions that are only supposed to transfer them. In our fictitious Merkle tree above, if each leaf held a value of one, the root hash would hold a value of four.
The Sparse Merkle tree adds yet another property. All of its leaves are indexed, allowing access to information on the tree in a key-value pair fashion, and it has empty leaves, which actually hold the “null” value, allowing us to check if some data is not in the tree. This property, known as proof of non-membership, is possible by proving membership of null in a given leaf which can be accessed through its index. For example, if there is a claim that the leaf with index six stores some information about an asset, we can prove that such information is not there by attesting that that leaf actually holds a value “null.”
Transferring A Taro Asset
Taro represents assets with nested MS-SMTs, one for each asset ID or asset type. The protocol enables those trees to be layered on top of each other, branching out of the initial Taproot script tree to represent an effectively unlimited number of assets in a single Taproot UTXO. Taro assets are therefore issued on chain.
At the basis of asset functionality on Taro is an asset script, a set of directives established by a developer to programmatically define how a given asset can be transferred on the protocol. The hash of that script is then included in the MS-SMT so it can be easily enforced later on — thereby making the asset and its attributes commit to the asset script hash.
The initial version of Taro proposes the use of a subset of Bitcoin Script, allowing assets to express arbitrary conditions for the valid transfer of an asset. As asset scripts inherit a level of programmability on par with Bitcoin Script, Taro assets can be transferred over Lightning in multi-hop transactions off-chain through hash time locked contracts (HTLCs) embedded in the asset script. However, future versions could introduce new opcodes and extra functionality that would only exist at the Taro level.
“Doing Taproot-within-Taproot makes the initial version simpler and gives us more time to figure out what use cases pop up and desire more expressivity,” Osuntokun said.
For on-chain transfers, Taro leverages a new address format based on bech32 that also includes the asset script hash. To receive a Taro asset on chain, the receiver would need to create an address with enough data that details how the sender can construct a new asset script group that contains the information needed to spend the asset once it is transferred over to the new owner. In other words, the extra information, in the asset script hash, tells the receiver what the unlocking capability is for the asset that is being transferred, so that it can eventually be transferred again.
Since the receiver has all of that information, they can compute the asset leaf, which then lets them compute the asset root, and finally the entire output itself, letting them watch the Bitcoin blockchain for the result they computed.
Additionally, by having the receiver send that defining information beforehand, the only way the sender can make the transaction valid is if they send exactly what the receiver is expecting. If the wrong asset or the wrong amount is sent, the hashes won’t match and the receiver can easily tell that the sender did something wrong.
Assets And Collectibles On Bitcoin
The issuance and transfer of assets in Taro vary, depending on whether the asset is a regular one or a collectible.
A collectible, or non-fungible asset, is a one-of-a-kind representation of value, with a unique identifier that establishes a claim on an asset at the Bitcoin chain level or at the real-world level and makes it impossible to counterfeit ownership. A collectible on Taro could be a tokenized rare baseball card, for example. Collectibles are created in a single batch transaction, cannot be split or merged, and need to be transferred off-chain or put into a multiparty channel to be transferred among a known set of participants.
A regular asset, on the other hand, commits to a total value of held assets and can be split and merged. Splits can happen within a tree, configuring an internal split, or across different Taproot outputs, configuring an external split. During transfer, the asset holder proves they hold a valid split with a Merkle-Sum proof and the corresponding created assets commit to a new Merkle-Sum output split that ensures the total amount of assets after transfer equals the total amount there was before the transaction.
Assets At The Edges: Lightning As A Decentralized Backbone Payment Network
As mentioned earlier, Taro can port assets issued on-chain onto the Lightning Network, similar to how bitcoin can be sent through Lightning after being locked up in a two-of-two multisignature output that gets confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain. A Lightning channel holding Taro assets leverages the same flow, however the two-of-two Schnorr Taproot output would also commit to the set of assets in the channel.
“Using the Taro protocol, Lightning channels anchored with a Taproot output are able to send both bitcoin and Taro assets off-chain, with multi-hop payments being facilitated by new HTLCs on the Taro level, which use the scripting system to implement the expected end-to-end payment security guarantees,” Osuntokun told Bitcoin Magazine.
Osuntokun added that Lightning Labs’ proposed deployment path for Taro on the Lightning Network seeks to first only introduce assets at the edges, meaning it would avoid both having to modify the core of the network and bootstrap a new network with adequate liquidity for each Taro asset. Rather, the company’s plans would have Taro plug into bitcoin liquidity on Lightning and require only the sender and receiver of a given asset to use Taro-aware channels.
“The only constraint is that in order to receive/send using a particular asset, corresponding inbound/outbound liquidity is required,” Osuntokun said.
In addition to the similar Lightning on-ramp setup, multi-hop transfers of Taro assets over Lightning would leverage a similar invoicing system that is commonplace on the second layer today. However, instead of denominating the invoice in BTC, the invoice would be denominated in the Taro asset itself.
“As an example, if Alice wants to send Bob a Taro stablecoin asset, she’ll create a new invoice that quotes, say, $10,” Osuntokun said. “Bob will then use a ‘hop hint,’ which are extra routing details provided in the invoice to complete the route and calculate the amount of network fees (paid in bitcoin) to send over his first hop, which will traverse the internal Bitcoin backbone and eventually drop off enough BTC at the final hop to complete the payment.”
The Taro protocol will specify the extra information that needs to be sent to the Lightning peers at the edges in order to update all channels properly, he added.
Making Bitcoin The De-Facto Base Layer
Taro seeks to leverage Bitcoin’s latest soft fork upgrade to bring assets with real-word use cases like U.S. dollar stablecoins onto the peer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency stack. It enables the issuance of a nearly unlimited number of assets with a single Taproot UTXO, as well as the transfer of such assets with instant, low-fee multi-hop transactions on Lightning.
By leveraging Bitcoin and Lightning as its rails, Taro could establish an interoperable ecosystem of assets that can unite different use cases while not affecting parties that may not care about such assets. At the same time, the protocol also contributes back to Bitcoin by increasing its network effects in the event that a popularization of the concept drives traffic on the network, thereby increasing the fee payout to miners and ramping up BTC liquidity on the Lightning Network.
Though its initial iteration accommodates a limited number of use cases, in an attempt to make the jump onto the new protocol easier for developers through a familiar Bitcoin scripting suite, the possibilities of extensions and further developments are nearly endless, as builders and entrepreneurs get creative and spin the protocol to suit their needs.
“The hope is to open up people’s eyes to what the future of Bitcoin holds and what Taproot can enable,” Stark told Bitcoin Magazine. “The goal is to have Bitcoin be the underlying global monetary network powered by open protocols.”"

On Dec. 3, 2021, Bitcoin initiated a 25.6% correction that lasted 18 hours and culminated with a $42,360 low. Four months later, the price remained 18% below the $56,650, closing on Dec. 2, 2021.
Much has changed over that period, and hard evidence comes from other sections of the sector. Between February 15 and April 2, 2022, enterprise software development firm MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of 4,197 Bitcoin.
Inflows to Canadian Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also hit an all-time high, according to data from Glassnode. These investment vehicles in Canada have increased their holdings by 6,594 BTC since January to a historical high of 69,052 BTC under management. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF, a spot instrument, currently has $1.68 billion worth of assets.
Among the wave of recent buyers is Terra’s Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), which is on a mission to acquire $3 billion worth of BTC as a reserve for TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin.
CoinMetrics data shows that the active on-year Bitcoin supply reached 36.8% on April 5, its lowest level since September 2010.

The chart shows how “diamond hand” holders have not moved their coins over the past 12 months.
Futures markets show traders are uncomfortable near $47,000
To understand how professional traders are positioned, including whales and market makers, let's look at Bitcoin's futures and options market data. The basis indicator measures the difference between longer-term futures contracts and the current spot market levels.
The Bitcoin futures annualized premium should run between 5% to 12% to compensate traders for ""locking in"" the money for two to three months until the contract expiry. Levels below 5% are extremely bearish, while the numbers above 12% indicate bullishness.

The above chart shows that this metric dipped below 5% on Feb. 11, reflecting traders’ lack of demand for leverage long (bull) positions. The sentiment changed on March 26 after the basis rate regained the “neutral” 5% threshold. Even though this occurred, there are no signs of confidence from pro traders, according to the futures premium.
Options traders worry about downside risk
Currently, Bitcoin seems to lack the strength needed to break the $47,000 resistance, but traders should use derivatives to gauge professional investor sentiment. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.
If those traders fear a Bitcoin price crash, the skew indicator will move above 10%. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 10% skew.
Bitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch
Data shows that the skew indicator has been ranging between 0% and 8% since March 9. Albeit not signaling fear, these options traders are overcharging for downside protection. From the BTC options markets perspective, there's a slightly higher risk for unexpected downward price swings.
The neutral-to-bearish Bitcoin derivatives data offers an interesting opportunity for bulls. If somehow the $47,000 resistance is broken, this will be a surprise for most investors. Two positive effects will arise from that event: a short squeeze from derivatives markets and room for buyers to use futures for leverage.
If Bitcoin’s futures premium had been running above 10%, traders would face a much higher cost to add long (bull) positions. Bulls seem better prepared to deal with the $47,000 price resistance considering the sound market structure that is marked by the absence of exaggerated buyers’ leverage and this provides better odds of success.

Popular crypto tracker Whale Alert has spread the word about more than half a billion USD worth of Bitcoin cumulatively transferred between major U.S.-based digital exchange Coinbase and several anonymous crypto addresses.
Besides, two dormant Bitcoin wallets have been activated after 12.4 years with 100 BTC in them.
Whales withdraw $422.8 million, deposit $246.6 million in BTC
The aforementioned tracking service has reported that over the past 16 hours, anonymous whales have performed several transactions to deposit approximately $246 million worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase exchange and withdraw roughly $422 million from it to addresses tagged by Whale Alert as ""unknown.""
Anonymous whales have deposited a comprised 5,678 BTC to Coinbase and withdrawn 9,736 BTC from it. That is worth $246,629,608 and $422,892,896, respectively, at the time of writing.

Separately, 4,100 Bitcoins worth $178,865,674 were shifted from a Gemini address to Coinbase too, which were later withdrawn from it to an unknown address.
At the time of this writing, the global flagship digital currency is changing hands at $43,397, having lost roughly 5% in the past 24 hours.
The price faced a decline after the Fed discussion that did not rule out another interest rate hike – by 50 basis points. Along with Bitcoin losing 5% of its value, Nasdaq also plunged 4.5%.
Bitcoin exchange balance falls to 2018 lows
According to a Glassnode chart, the current Bitcoin supplies across multiple digital exchanges have reached the bottom of 2018, in the middle of ""Crypto Winter,"" when BTC was trading at around $7,200.
While the BTC price has dropped, some are locking in their profits by moving BTC to exchanges, while ""diamond"" hands are buying more and moving their crypto off to cold storage vaults.
Dormant Bitcoin wallets awaken after 12.4 years
Whale Alert has also reported that two dormant crypto wallets had came to life after 12.4 years, since 2009 basically, when the mysterious BTC author Satoshi Nakamoto was still more or less in public view.
These two wallets contained 50 BTC each, roughly $2,165,186 per wallet at the current exchange rate.
One of the possible explanations here is that the owners of these wallets had managed to recover the passwords or seed phrases to wallets they believed had been lost."

Taking the stage at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, MicroStategy CEO Michael Saylor and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood argued the case that the environment has never been more bullish for Bitcoin.
Walking through the current landscape with lenses focused on the macroeconomic environment, regulatory issues, and the level of capital markets acceptance, or capitulation as they see it, Saylor and Wood see a world where bitcoin will succeed no matter what happens in the world. In fact, Wood repeated a prediction made by her firm that each bitcoin will be worth $1 million by the year 2030.

The talk centered on how previous bitcoin skeptics are coming around to take positive dispositions towards the asset. Wood highlighted what she saw as a major about-face for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, whose commentary and public speeches have consistently warned about the negative implications of bitcoin and other digital assets for financial markets and consumer welfare.
However, in a recent interview with CNBC she said, “Crypto has obviously grown by leaps and bounds, and is now playing a significant role not really so much in transactions but in investment decisions of lots of Americans…There are benefits from crypto, and we recognize the innovation in the payment system can be a healthy thing.""
Saylor said he saw President Biden’s recent executive order dictating government agencies to study digital assets and assess their potential as the green light to Bitcoin. As far as he knows, “The President of the U.S. has never directed the government to embrace a new asset class,” he added.
Turning to capital markets, Saylor recalled an anecdote where he was essentially mocked by analysts at Merrill Lynch two years ago when he told them that he wanted to buy bitcoin with some of MicroStrategy’s funds at the bank. “They laughed at me and said, not only will I not sell it to you, we're not allowed to talk about it or we get fired.” In recalling the story he told the audience that he quickly wired $175 million out of the bank, and the ultimate comeuppance is that “Now my inbox has bitcoin research from Merrill Lynch, sent to me by the same broker. Like we're covering it now. This is what we think. So every bulge bracket farm is starting to cover it.”
Finally, both Saylor and Wood see bitcoin as an essential hedge and store of value amidst the current macroeconomic climate, which continues to struggle in the midst of rising inflation, uncertainty stemming from the rising impact of sanctions on Russia, and ongoing coronavirus surges around the world. In particular, Saylor noted, “Although the issues are unfortunate and unpleasant for the world, they each underscore the use case for a global non-sovereign store of value such as bitcoin.”
However, while both see bitcoin succeeding in the long-term, the asset is not immune to short-term macroeconomic headwinds. Wood sees it as a fallacy that investors bucket bitcoin into tech stocks, (which are currently struggling), hoping that that correlation will weaken over time as the asset gets more acceptance.
Bitcoin has also struggled in recent days, dropping 5% from above $47,000 to $43,375 as of 12:08pm ET."

265,2022-04-08,2022-04-08,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Dan Milmo,www.theguardian.com,Paypal founder launches tirade against ‘gerontocracy’ over bitcoin,"Peter Thiel, the libertarian tech investor, says figures such as Warren Buffett are hindering cryptocurrency",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/08/peter-thiel-paypal-founder-tirade-gerontocracy-bitcoin,"Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and a Donald Trump ally, has accused a “finance gerontocracy” including Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon of hindering bitcoin’s progress.
The outspoken libertarian tech investor described multibillionaire Buffett, the world’s richest investor, as the “sociopathic grandpa from Omaha” in a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on Thursday.
Thiel’s address began with an analysis of the investment merits of cryptocurrencies but soon escalated into a tirade against the financial establishment, including “bankrupt” central banks and the “hate factory” of ESG – which stands for environmental, social and corporate governance and is a cornerstone of responsible investing principles.
“It’s a movement, and it’s a political question, whether this movement is going to succeed, or whether the enemies of a movement are going to succeed in stopping us,” he said, shortly before naming Buffett as “enemy number one”.
In a speech that also cited JP Morgan’s chief executive Dimon and Larry Fink, the chair of investment group BlackRock, he said institutions run by a “finance gerontocracy” were hindering the cryptocurrency. Thiel said choosing not to invest in bitcoin was a “deeply political choice” and the financial establishment should be told “you have to get onboard on this”. Thiel added that the $830bn (£638bn) bitcoin market could rival the global equities market, worth more than $100tn.
Comparing bitcoin with conventional capitalism, he said, to applause: “Woke companies are sort of quasi-controlled by the government in a way that bitcoin never will be.” Thiel, 54, is the most high profile Trump supporter in the tech industry, having donated millions of dollars to Trump’s 2016 campaign and served on the ex-president’s transition team.

Casting the progress of bitcoin in political terms, Thiel rounded off his speech with a libertarian rallying cry depicting cryptocurrency’s progress as a battle between ESG and a “revolutionary youth movement”.
“If we had to summarise this in one frame, it is … the finance gerontocracy that runs the country through whatever silly virtue signalling, hate factory term like ESG they have versus what I would … think of as a revolutionary youth movement.”
He added: “We have to just go out from this conference and take over the world.”
Thiel announced in February that he was stepping down as a board director at Facebook’s parent, Meta. Thiel has been on the Meta board since 2005 and is a confidant of Meta’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg."

Digital payments company Block (formerly Square) and bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream have begun construction on a new open-source bitcoin mining facility, which will be powered by Tesla’s solar and energy storage products, announced Blockstream’s CEO Adam Back.
“This is a step to proving our thesis that Bitcoin mining can fund zero-emission power infrastructure and build economic growth for the future,” he added. The facility is planned to be completed later this year and will result in a projected 3.8 Megawatts of solar renewable power (e.g. off-grid energy) and a 30 Petahash (PH) hash rate.
The $12 million joint initiative was first announced in June 2021 as part of Block's pledge to be carbon neutral by 2030. The fintech giant will invest $6 million (the other half will be provided by Blockstream) in a facility to be built at one of Blockstream's U.S. sites in Texas.
Co-founded in 2014 by Back, a British cryptographer whose early proof of work system influenced bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto (Back was once rumored to be Nakamoto himself), Victoria, Canada-based Blockstream is best known for the creation of Liquid, a bitcoin sidechain that enables cryptocurrency exchanges, traders and institutions to issue digital assets and conduct transactions at a greater speed than the bitcoin network allows. The firm also offers mining, hosting and energy efficiency development services.
According to the announcement, in addition to providing regular reports on the economics of the project, a publicly accessible dashboard showing real-time metrics of the projectʼs performance, including power output and the amount of bitcoin mined will be made available. A later version of the dashboard will also include solar and storage performance data points “to serve as an industry case study for future projects.”
In recent months, ​​bitcoin miners, regularly criticized for significant energy consumption, have been adopting the so-called ‘green’ strategies. For instance, in Texas, the latest hot spot for crypto mining, miners like HODL Ranch and publicly traded Riot Blockchain buy up excess energy when it’s not needed, then shut down their mining rigs when demand surges, releasing power back onto the grid, to ensure that there’s enough power for extreme events like ice storms and summer heat waves, or connect to grids where the majority of electricity comes from renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
Earlier this week, the largest publicly traded bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) said it plans to relocate its mining machines away from a coal-powered site in Montana to new (unspecified) locations “with more sustainable and non-carbon emitting sources of power.”"

Tesla's 3.8 megawatt solar PV array and 12 megawatt-hour Megapack will power the facility.
Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back, a British cryptographer and a member of the ""cypherpunk"" crew, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami that the mining facility is designed to be a proof of concept for 100% renewable energy bitcoin mining at scale.
""People like to debate about the different factors to do with bitcoin mining. We figured, let's just prove it. Have an open dashboard so people can play along, maybe it can inform other players to participate,"" Back said.
The dashboard will be publicly accessible and show real-time metrics of the project's performance, including power output and total bitcoin mined. The company said a later version of the dashboard will also include solar and storage performance data points.

In addition to the fact that the industry consumes a large amount of energy, it is not only an inefficient form of money.",https://readwrite.com/environmental-impact-of-cryptocurrency/,"As the world struggles with significant environmental changes due to industrial pollution, fossil fuels, and the primary reason for climate change, cryptocurrency has become in the discussion of climate change.
Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are being produced by mining, and mining takes a lot of energy to create bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency.
There has been a race for becoming crypto millionaires, and everybody wants to win in this race, creating a good amount of electronic waste than fat bank accounts.
Here’s how you can know how much energy is being consumed that can cost significant changes in climate change.
How Much Energy is too much?
The apparent reason for the environmental impact of Crypto on climate change is how they are being generated, and they are being caused by electricity to what we call digital coins.
As we know that many types of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, hardly rely upon mining, and after Bitcoin’s release, it has become harder to mint new units through the mining process.
So the total amount for bitcoin to mint is 21 million, and the more mint takes place, the more computational power needs to mint the left ones.
Bitcoin is the most expensive cryptocurrency (The price of one bitcoin is 42,000$, checked by this bitcoin calculator as of this writing). Since it tops the prices and other currencies, everyone wants to mine bitcoin to have some or a good portion in their pockets.
Therefore, it takes more computational power and electricity to mint new ones. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index states that bitcoin mining uses more electricity power globally than Netherlands and Pakistan.
The current miners with considerable income are Antminer S19j Pro, Antminer L7, Innosilicon A10 Pro, and others.
The environmental concerns come due to the production of carbon footprints by the power plants. A single bitcoin transaction takes 2,292.5 kilowatt-hours of Energy which is good enough to deliver electricity to a typical US household for over 78 days.
How come Environment concerns in Crypto?
Many countries use fossil fuels to generate electricity, resulting in carbon mixing in the atmosphere and worsening the climate.
Approximately 35% of bitcoin operations occur in the USA alone,
and the University of Cambridge has estimated that 60% of power is generated through fossil fuels.
There’s also an issue with the physical waste. As everybody is in the race to build more coins, miners use graphics cards, computers, and purpose-built ASIC rigs to mine bitcoin. They usually through away the old products and buy new ones.
Which produces physical waste, and therefore there has been a lot of electronic waste.
Why Crypto Uses So much Energy?
Digital currencies consume so much electricity that no group of people or network could control them. Therefore, they are called decentralized currencies, which means they have no single control point.
Popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on the proof of work (PoW) system. It relies on users having to solve problems of varying difficulty to create new coins and add new blocks of data to the blockchain of a cryptocurrency.
The idea behind this system was developed to protect against cyberattacks in which a person creates numerous fake identities and then uses them to control most of the network.
Conclusion
Despite the benefits of cryptocurrency, the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is still a controversial issue. In addition to the fact that the industry consumes a large amount of energy, it is not only an inefficient form of money.
The digital infrastructure of the currency industry is also energy-intensive. The mining computer needs massive amounts of Energy. Further, data processing on these computers requires large quantities of Energy. Therefore, it is not surprising that the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is so high."

Bitcoin was trading close to its long-term support level during Saturday’s session, as the decline in crypto markets continued. The price of ETH was also lower to start the weekend, falling below $3,200 in the process.
Bitcoin
Cryptocurrency markets were down by over 2% on Saturday, with BTC falling by the same amount to start the weekend.
On Saturday, BTC/USD was trading close to its $42,000 support level for the majority of the session, following an earlier low of $42,183.25.
This drop follows on from Friday’s intraday high of $43,903.02, however as volatility continued to rise, trades liquidated some positions, sending prices lower.
However, the drop fell short of breaking out of the floor, as the downward momentum eased, despite the moving averages nearing the point of a crossover.
Looking at the chart, momentum fell as we hit another key support point, this time in the form of the 14-day RSI, which saw the 43.55 floor hold firm.
Should this be broken, bears will likely look to take BTC/USD towards the $40,000 point, however, bulls could possibly look to hold the line.
Ethereum
After attempting to withstand the current red wave, the world’s second-largest crypto was finally submerged, as ETH fell below $3,200 today.
ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $3,179.14 to start the weekend, which came less than 24 hours after hitting a high above $3,300.
Saturday’s drop means that ETH is now down close to 9% in the last seven days, and as such, is staying close to its long-term floor.
This current support level in ETH is at the $3,145 point, which has been in place since March 21, following an engulfing bullish candlestick which broke the then ceiling.
Now acting as a support, ETH has been trading close to this zone for the last three sessions, which many see as the sign of a sustained spell of consolidation, following its recent bullish streak.
The 14-day RSI continues to also consolidate, moving between the 51 and 55 levels, with many not expecting any substantial change in momentum, until these points are broken.
How long do you expect this consolidation to continue? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

They’ve all been saved by Bitcoin (BTC) mining. From reusing “waste” heat to getting the job done — to receiving a cool blast of air to dehydrate meat, to cleaning up pollutants, Bitcoin mining does more than just secure the network.
Here’s a round-up of seven times Bitcoin mining lent a hand or simply made the world a better place.
Free Bitcoin mining education in Washington
Sustainable Bitcoin mining company Merkle Standard has taken Bitcoin mining education into its own hands. In partnership with Bitmain, they recently gifted the latest in Bitcoin mining technology to Newport High School, a high school in Washington state.
Plus, they donated $10,000 and are promoting education about Bitcoin in the hope that it will, “plant a seed that encourages lifelong interest in blockchain and digital mining.”
Along with the check, Ruslan Zinurov, Merkle Standard's CEO, told Cointelegraph that they will also invite students to their “data center to check on their machine that is hashing to their school’s wallet.” Zinurov told Cointelegraph:
“It is our top priority to get the community excited about Bitcoin and we can't think of a better way to do this than to educate the local students.”
Adam Delderfield, business development manager at Bitmain — the holding company for the Antminer Bitcoin miners — told Cointelegraph, “Digital currency mining proceeds from this gift will go directly to education,” adding that “Bitcoin mining and proof-of-work represent an exciting new industry that opens up numerous new opportunities.”

Bitcoin miner beef jerky cooked up by the Business Cat chef
Bitcoiner Business Cat, who wishes to remain nameless, uses the heat vented by Bitcoin mining to dry out meat to be made into beef jerky. They told Cointelegraph, “Bitcoin miners have one hell of an excess of supply of dry, heated air,” so it makes sense to funnel that heat over strips of beef to make jerky.
Similar to Merkle Standard, for the Business Cat, the jerky cooking process is not about making money: “My normal food dehydrator uses much less energy than an S9, but hashpower dried jerky just tastes better.”
They told Cointelegraph that “the support of the plebs on Bitcoin Twitter” persuaded them to try out the idea. They joked that “most of us [Bitcoin plebs] are natural loners, so a few words of praise or support from others on the path goes a long way.”
The Bitcoin community is increasingly supportive of ideas that promote Bitcoin philosophy and Bitcoin-only ideas, from a Bitcoin hostel in Portugal to a Bitcoin lake project in Guatemala.

Business Cat is delighted with their experience and suggests others take up home mining. They combined life advice with Bitcoin mining advice explaining to Cointelegraph:
“Should you mine Bitcoin at home? Yes. Should you learn to be a better chef? Also yes.”
Bitcoin heats my swimming pool
Bitcoin enthusiast Jonathan Yuan found a cheaper, faster and more stable way of heating his swimming pool in Minnesota, all thanks to Bitcoin mining.
Thanks to immersion heating, Bitcoin now powers up his pool. Even though Yuan doesn’t care for swimming, his kids are happy to swim in the pool while he secures the Bitcoin network.

Yuan told Cointelegraph that the whole experiment went so swimmingly that he’s now planning on heating “the whole house.”
Propane gas tank heater broke down? Bitcoin miner to the rescue!
Michael Schmid is a well-traveled, savvy Bitcoiner. When his caravan’s propane gas heater broke down, he refitted the vehicle to be warmed by the “waste” heat from an S9 Bitcoin miner.
Schmid told Cointelegraph that he saves “around 50% of the propane costs, which is around $2.7 per day.”
“Now the fun part, the miner produces around 0.00006259 BTC per day (with the current difficulty and 13 TH/s) on the current price of 38 thousand. This is $2.40 per day, so we technically heat the airstream for free.”

Plus, a kick in the teeth to the anti-Bitcoin environmentalists — heating the Schmid family airstream with Bitcoin rather than propane gas is better for the planet.
“Our Airstream has solar panels on top of it that can generate up to 400W of energy, so technically of the 1400W that the miner uses, 400W of them are self-generated and fully renewable.”
Bitcoin miner waste heat dries out timber
Kryptovault is a Norwegian Bitcoin mining company with arguably the greenest credentials among any industry. Powered by 100% hydropower, the energy it uses solves valid blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain and the heat generated by the miners blows over damp logs from a local timber mill.

In a video made by the company, Sveni Bjerke, CEO of local firewood company Varma, which receives the miner-dried logs, says that they are “only using excess heat from the data center.”
The environmental success of the project has spurred further partnerships. Kjetil Hove Pettersen, CEO of KryptoVault, told Cointelegraph that drying out seaweed for local companies is coming soon, and they are “constantly looking for new ways of utilizing our waste heat.”
Pettersen explained, ""Approximately 99% of our electric energy turns into thermal energy.""
“ As we know, energy is never truly lost, it only changes form. So this is a way of us to utilize this energy twice and support other local industries in the process. I can’t think of any better industrial use-cases than what we are doing.”
Promoting financial and energy autonomy in Guatemala
In south Guatemala, a team of Bitcoin miners donated an S9 to the local mayor and the mining proceeds are being used to repair a wastewater treatment plant.

Bitcoin mining in the economically disadvantaged region has boosted incomes while improving the air quality.
Plus, as Bill Whittaker, a co-founder of Bitcoin Lake, told Cointelegrpah, the team is “self-funding carbon-negative Bitcoin mining R&D.” Two high school students, Madaket and Kate, are planning a trip down to “LakeBitcoin in early May to deliver the S17s they have been working on.”
The Bitcoin miners they bring will join the first Bitcoin miner, and naturally will be powered by renewable energy — in this case, biogas. Biogas is growing in popularity as an energy source for Bitcoin mining.

Bitcoin mining grows flowers and food
A greenhouse in the Netherlands is heated by Bitcoin miners rather than natural gas. That's according to Bert de Groot, founder of Bitcoin Bloem.

In partnership with a large greenhouse, they ""placed a Bitcoin miner to reduce the use of natural gas, the prices of which have skyrocketed, and heat the greenhouse with miner heat instead."" De Groot continued:
“The family that owns the greenhouse first put electric heaters because of the 6x cost of natural gas, they now get paid for their electricity, which is used for mining, and receive the heat for free.”
It's a win-win situation. After all, who can say no to flowers?

Asked about the electronic waste issues that the mainstream media associates with Bitcoin mining, de Groot said, “A miner should last for at least five years. We don’t know of any ASIC (S9) that has been turned to e-waste yet.”
Plus, they're also fans of delivering flowers to their local community."

Unease Over Fed’s Monetary Policy Tightening
According to an email from Oanda Senior Market Analyst Americas Edward Moya:
“Bitcoin is unsure of its direction as Wall Street gets concerned about the central bank’s aggressiveness in tightening monetary policy.”
Following these recent price swings, various experts expressed their predictions for the cryptocurrency’s future direction.
Ben McMillan, chief information officer at IDX Digital Assets, weighed in, indicating critical levels of support and opposition.
“$43k is a critical support level in the near term as bitcoin attempts to build on its recent relative strength,” he noted.

Containing Inflation
Cryptocurrency prices deviated somewhat from the performance of the main equities markets, which were marginally positive. The Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted toward the tech sector, gained less than a tenth of a percentage point.
The US central bank has communicated strongly over the last week, both collectively and through individual governors, that it will step up efforts to contain inflation, which has hit about 8%, a four-decade high.
The correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and US equities has increased in the last 90 days as investors have become more risk averse in response to the Federal Reserve’s withdrawal of the pandemic-era intervention that is attributed with catalyzing the ascent of cryptocurrency.

From a price of US$1 in 2011, Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of more than US$63,000 in April 2021, and now hovers around the US$42,000 mark.
Large fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices are common, which makes them a highly speculative investment. What kind of people are willing to take the risk, and what motivates them?
We conducted a survey to find out. In particular, we wanted to know about the relationship between the so-called “dark tetrad” personality traits and attitudes towards cryptocurrency.
The dark tetrad
In psychology, the “dark tetrad” refers to a group of four personality traits. These are Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy (together known as the “dark triad”), plus sadism.
They are called “dark” because of their “evil” qualities: extreme selfishness and taking advantage of others without empathy. The dark tetrad are also often related to risk-taking behaviours.
The appeal of cryptocurrency
We identified two main areas of appeal. First, the high risks and high potential returns of crypto trading make it attractive to the kind of people who like gambling.
Second, cryptocurrencies are not issued or backed by governments like traditional or “fiat” currencies. This makes them attractive to people who distrust government.
What are the personalities of crypto buyers?
We asked 566 people to complete online personality surveys as well as answer questions about their attitudes to crypto and whether or not they planned to invest in it. Of our participants, 26% reported they own crypto and 64% showed interest in crypto investing.
We measured their dark tetrad traits using standard psychological tests. We also measured traits that might connect the dark tetrad to judgements about crypto: fear of missing out (FOMO; the feeling that others are experiencing better things than you are), positivity (the tendency to be positive or optimistic in life), and belief in conspiracy theories.
Why do people want to buy crypto? It’s not just about making money
A common reason to invest in crypto is the hope of earning high returns. Beyond the desire to build wealth, our research shows dark personality traits also drive crypto buying.
Machiavellianism is named after the Italian political philosophy of Niccolò Machiavelli. People who rate highly on this trait are good at deception and interpersonal manipulation.
Machiavellians take a calculated approach to achieving goals, and avoid impulsive decisions. They are less likely to engage in problem gambling.
Read more: Behind the crypto hype is an ideology of social change
Machiavellians also tend to believe strongly in government conspiracies. For example, they often believe politicians usually do not reveal their true motives, and that government agencies closely monitor all citizens.
We found Machiavellians like crypto primarily because they distrust politicians and government agencies. Many crypto supporters believe governments are corrupt, and crypto avoids government corruption.
Overconfidence and positivity
Narcissism is a self-centred personality trait, characterised by feelings of privilege and predominance over others. Narcissists are overconfident and are more willing to do things like make risky investments in the stock market and gamble.
Narcissists tend to focus on the positive side of life. We found narcissists like crypto because of their great faith in the future, and because of their confidence their own lives will improve.
Impulsive psychopaths like crypto
Psychopathy is a callous, impulsive antisocial personality trait. Psychopathic people often find it difficult to perceive, understand, or address emotions due to a lack of emotional intelligence and empathy.
The reckless nature of psychopaths makes them more resistant to stress and anxiety. As a result, psychopaths like stimulation-seeking and risk-taking. They are prone to gambling and gambling addiction.
We found that impulsive psychopaths like crypto, because they fear missing out on investing rewards that others are experiencing.
How is sadism involved?
Everyday sadism relates to a personality enjoying another’s suffering. Sadists often display aggression and cruel behaviours. For example, sadists troll others on the Internet for enjoyment.
At first glance, buying crypto is unlikely to harm others. However, we found sadists like crypto because they do not want to miss out on investment rewards either. To them, perhaps both the pleasure from seeing another’s pain and the fear of missing out are related to selfishness.
Unlike narcissists, we found both psychopaths and sadists lack positivity about their prospects, which cancels out their liking of crypto.

A psychological lens
Studying cryptocurrency through the psychological lens of the dark tetrad offers insight into why people want to buy crypto. We are not suggesting that everyone interested in crypto displays dark tetrad traits.
We studied only a subset of people interested in crypto who do have these traits. If you happen to be a Bitcoin or other crypto holder, you may or may not exhibit them.
If you want to know how you score for dark tetrad traits, you can do the Dark Triad Personality Test and Sadism Test online."

Bitcoin prices have suffered some weakness lately, falling below $40,000 this afternoon and trading close to that level since then.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value first declined below $40,000 around 3:15 p.m. EDT, CoinDesk data shows.
The digital currency quickly bounced back, rising above $40,000 and surpassing $40,200 near 4:30 p.m. EDT, additional CoinDesk figures reveal.
Following this short-lived recovery, bitcoin gave up all the gains it had made, declining to an intra-day low of $39,253.69 at roughly 6:15 p.m. EDT.
At the time of this writing, the digital asset had recovered slightly, trading below $39,800.

Following these latest price movements, several experts offered their perspective on what the cryptocurrency might do next.
Some of them provided technical analysis, emphasizing key levels of support and resistance that traders should keep in mind.
Collin Plume, CEO and founder of My Digital Money, offered this kind of input.
“For a while, $40K was a major resistance level. When the price of Bitcoin hit $47K, it was natural for investors to want to cash out to make some gains, especially those who bought in during the dip.”
He emphasized that while “It will bounce around the $40K level,” the $42,000 level is the one to watch.
“It will make several attempts to break $50K, and it will fail many times, but once it crosses $50K, it will pull back again before it jogs to $60k,” he predicted.
Plume stated that if bitcoin pushes lower, it has “Support levels at $37k-$40k.”
William Noble, the chief technical analyst of research platform Token Metrics, also weighed in, offering a similar point of view.
Bitcoin has key support levels at $39,000 and after that, $36,000, he stated.
Going forward, he made some predictions that could prove beneficial for the digital currency.
“Bitcoin will likely become the dominant cryptocurrency between now and August,” he stated.
“If interest rates continue to rise, altcoins may drop faster than bitcoin,” said Noble.
“A measure like bitcoin dominance has bottomed. BTC dominance could go from its low near 41% to 47%.”
“A move like this would be in line with the idea that bitcoin is going to be the only logical crypto to own as equities and bonds drop.”
Plume offered a different outlook that was more focused on the short term.
“With taxes due in the next few days and the IRS having issues with new forms and legislation, many investors are in a holding pattern,” he stated.
“Many bitcoin holders and consistent buyers are waiting to see where they are going to shake out for last year. Once they know prices will jump again.”

Cryptocurrency trading volumes in India have plunged further across exchanges as traders mull over the 30% crypto taxation. In addition, popular payment service provider Mobikwik has stopped service to exchanges.
Crypto Trading Volume in India Plunges Further
Cryptocurrency trading volume in India continues to slide after the government began taxing crypto income at 30% without allowing any loss offsets or deductions.
According to crypto research firm Crebaco, cryptocurrency trading volumes have fallen from last week across all major exchanges, Moneycontrol reported. Wazirx suffered a 72% drop in trading volume, Coindcx 52%, and Zebpay 59%.
In addition, MobiKwik reportedly withdrew its services across exchanges on April 1 amid unclear regulations. Mobikwik was one of the preferred methods of payment to purchase cryptocurrencies at exchanges.
A crypto exchange executive was quoted by the publication as saying:
Mobikwik did not give any specific reason for withdrawing its services. We were just told that they won’t be partnering with exchanges anymore.
Last week, the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase announced that it has fully launched in India and users could transfer funds to buy crypto using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system. However, the National Payments Corporation of India (NCPI), which created UPI, responded by stating that no crypto exchange is using the UPI system.
On July 1, another damaging tax will go into effect. Crypto transactions will be levied a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS). An Indian parliament member recently explained why this tax will kill the crypto industry.
Meanwhile, the Indian government is still working on a framework for crypto. Finance ministry officials are reportedly consulting with international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as well as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and other domestic regulators.
What do you think about Indian trading volumes plunging after the 30% tax went into effect and Mobikwik withdrew service to exchanges? Let us know in the comments section below.

Find out what this means for BTC-USD here.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4501294-bitcoin-will-price-go-back-up-2022,"SKapl/iStock Editorial via Getty Images
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell sharply after the 2022 Bitcoin Miami Conference where over 25,000 Bitcoiners joined together in South Florida to learn more about how the world's oldest cryptocurrency will change the world forever.
It's been a tough few months for Bitcoiners ever since BTC reached all-time highs in November 2021. As of lately, Bitcoin has a strong correlation to the stock market and we've witnessed a crypto selloff alongside stocks over the past few months.
There are several global headwinds that have contributed to the recent bearish trends including:
Rising inflation
Russia-Ukraine War
Shanghai Covid-19 outbreak
Higher bond yields
etc.
If you bought Bitcoin during the recent all-time highs, then you are probably wondering if BTC will rise to all-time highs again in 2022.
As much as I believe in Bitcoin, I don't think 2022 will be a positive year for Bitcoiners. Historical trends indicate cryptocurrency will continue selling off to as low as $30,000 (or even lower) based on the current position in the Bitcoin halving cycle.
It's important to understand that fiat currency is driven by military and politicians while Bitcoin is driven by math. If you understand how the Bitcoin halving cycle works, then you accurately determine the best time to buy and sell your coins.
Keenan Mell wrote an excellent article on Bitcoin halving cycle but I want to dig a bit deeper into the specific reasons why Bitcoin will go lower in 2022 and how you can profit from this information.
Understanding the 3 Stages of the Bitcoin Halving Cycle
When Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the Bitcoin code, he wanted to reduce the supply of available Bitcoin over time to increase demand and prevent price dilution in a decentralized manner.
The first Bitcoin genesis block produced a reward of 50 Bitcoins and that number gets cut in half every 4 years (or 210,000 blocks).
Bitcoin Halving History (DeltecBank.com)
The next halving is scheduled at block height #840,000 or approx. March 2nd, 2024. Right now, the current block reward is 6.25 BTC and we are currently sitting at block #731,533 as of writing this article.
Current Bitcoin Block Number (CoinMarketCap.com)
Bitcoin introduces a new block every 10 minutes but how does this help predict the direction of Bitcoin's movement?
Let's take a look at the 3 stages of every Bitcoin cycle:
Bullish uptrend post halving (green area)
Bearish selloff (red area)
Accumulation and recovery moving towards the next halving (blue area)
Bitcoin Halving Cycles (SeekingAlpha.com)
The 4th halving started at block #630,000, so we are currently in the bearish trend of the currency Bitcoin cycle. We won't reach the end of this current stage until Bitcoin reaches the block height of 770,000 or approx. January 11th, 2023.
Bitcoin Could Bottom in Price During January 2023
From a historical standpoint, Bitcoin will continue trending much lower throughout 2022 but could bottom in January of next year.
Other Seeking Alpha authors have backed up this claim but realize most retail investors aren't aware of the currency cycle. So many people put all of their hopes and dreams into Bitcoin pumping every year but this just isn't the case.
The top 2% of all Bitcoin holders control nearly 95% of the coins and they are able to control price action over the short term.
Bitcoin Rich List (Bitinfocharts.com)
Don't obsess over the short term but brace yourself mentally for a bigger price drop.
Bitcoin Could Approach Key Support Levels of $30,000
Bitcoin currently trades at around $40,000, but I wouldn't be surprised if BTC dropped to as low in $30,000 in the next few months. We are currently in the downswing of the cycle plus dealing with mounting global headwinds too.
MicroStrategy (MSTR) holds 129K Bitcoin with an average purchase price of $30,700 per coin, which serves as a huge level of support moving forward.
MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor onboarded thousands of institutional investors since 2020 and Wall Street is well aware of his entry price.
The good news is Bitcoin has never dipped lower than its previous high during the preceding cycle. Bitcoin reached $18,000 during the 3rd cycle so we shouldn't experience a massive 50% selloff according to previous historical data.
$25,000 is a possibility but I expect a lot of smart investors to buy the dip in a hurry. By then, most retail investors will have sold at a loss and only institutional whales will begin accumulation. As much as I want to trade Bitcoin for profits, I still believe in forgetting about the price and holding long term.
Think in Terms of 4-Year Cycles
Bitcoin moves in 4-year cycles so investors should think in terms of ""Do I want to hold Bitcoin for at least half a decade or more?""
First off, you avoid paying capital gains taxes (for US investors) if you refrain from selling and just hold. Historically, Bitcoin has soared every 4 years and reached higher highs and higher lows.
Documenting Bitcoin published a powerful tweet that shows just how much Bitcoin can soar if you think in terms of 4-year cycles.
The tweet above shows 3 news articles where Bitcoin dipped below key levels:
$400 on April 10th, 2014
$4,000 on November 25th, 2018
$40,000 on January 10th, 2022
Bitcoin could repeat history again in 2026 and we may news articles about BTC dipping below $400,000. The point is don't let price action cloud your long-term thinking. Bitcoin is a wonderful store of value that made a lot of investors rich if they simply held and did nothing.
Conclusion
Millions of baby boomers should be preparing for a relaxed retirement but instead are contemplating a return to the workplace in their senior years.
Bitcoin offers Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z an alternative to relying on the government and our employers as we age.
I fully believe Bitcoin will reach $400,000+ by 2026 and exceed $1 million by 2030 as Bitcoin adoption takes over the globe.
Just owning even a fraction of 1 coin in safe cold storage could provide a substantial nest egg along with your 401(k), IRA, and other investments.
We live in a period of hyperinflation and it's too risky to rely on just the S&P 500 and the government to take care of us in the future.
Do your own research and consider allocating a percentage of your portfolio into Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency uncertainty.
You may be frustrated now but will thank yourself later for exhibiting patience and conviction as we move towards a global Bitcoin standard."

Traders line up targets below $40,000
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that lines in the sand below $40,000 barely remain intact after multiple retests.
The $40,000 mark has been working overtime in recent days as Bitcoin’s macro-fueled downtrend continues to play out. Falling in line with tech stocks, BTC/USD has erased almost all of its gains from the second half of March.
Now, the $30,000-$40,000 corridor has appeared as a short-term target once again and may see Bitcoin stage a replay of its behavior from Q1 this year.
Support levels of interest include one from last month’s push higher, $39,600, which bulls are just about managing to defend despite several crossings lower.

Below that, whale buying zones could act as a safety net, on-chain monitoring resource Whalemap noted on April 12.
Popular trader Crypto Ed, meanwhile, is eyeing $38,600 as a short-term bounce area, underscoring the mixed consensus over just how far Bitcoin could fall.
As Cointelegraph previously reported, Arthur Hayes, ex-CEO of derivatives platform BitMEX, expects the largest cryptocurrency to trade at $30,000 in June.
On longer timeframes, analyst Kevin Svenson, meanwhile, eyed the 600-day simple moving average (SMA) as a key support line now being retested in what could be a significant event.
“BTC has not closed a daily candle below the 600d/SMA since the COVID-19 crash,” he noted.
“The 600d/SMA has also been the main support for this range since mid-January. $39,250 is where 600d/SMA is at the moment.”

Data from its wallet confirms that the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), the nonprofit organization attached to Blockchain protocol Terra, added another 2,500 BTC, or $100.4 million, to its reserves on April 13.
This means that Terra now owns 42,400 BTC, worth around $1.704 billion at the time of writing — just 800 BTC less than Tesla’s corporate treasury allocation.
The purchases have so far come at a price. From being nearly $200 million in profit on its stash, Terra is now nearly $100 million in the red, thanks to the latest Bitcoin price dip.
Its wallet is the 18th largest on the Bitcoin network, and as Terra co-founder Do Kwon confirmed, its contents are set to grow “in perpetuity” as the firm seeks to back the expanding supply of its TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin.

Fast forward to border closures and shelling on her hometown, cash shortages at ATMs across the country, and the central bank suspending electronic cash transfers — and she decided to give bitcoin a try. Whereas money providers often charge transfer fees of 10% or more when you send $100 from the U.S. to Ukraine, bitcoin's Lightning Network, which is a payments platform built on bitcoin's base layer, slashes the cost of transactions to virtually zero. Vorobiova and CNBC decided to put Lightning payments to the test — with the expertise and translation skills of bitcoin developer Gleb Naumenko, who is currently hiding out in the western part of Ukraine as the war rages on. The bottom line? It really does work as well as bitcoin boosters say it does. The process of downloading a crypto wallet onto Vorobiova's phone, transferring bitcoin over the Lightning Network from the U.S. to Poland, and withdrawing the equivalent in Polish currency from a bitcoin ATM from the southwest city of Wrocław took less than three minutes.

Sending sats from Dallas to Miami to Poland
Last August on a road trip from Houston to Dallas, Peter McCormack — founder and host of the popular What Bitcoin Did' podcast — taught CNBC how to use the Lightning Network to make instant payments to anyone in the world. The tutorial took less than 60 seconds and involved four basic steps: We downloaded the Blue Wallet app and generated a one-time invoice in the form of a QR code. McCormack scanned that QR code using a similar app on his own phone, and then transferred 100,000 satoshis, or sats (the smallest denomination of bitcoin, about 0.00000001 BTC) from his account to ours. The total transfer was equivalent to about $50. Eight months later, from a hotel room in Miami on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference, CNBC decided to pay that knowledge — and some of those sats — forward.
On a three-way video call with Naumenko in Western Ukraine, Vorobiova in Southwest Poland, and CNBC in Miami, we followed a very similar sequence of events. With the guidance of Naumenko, Vorobiova downloaded the Muun wallet app, a different type of self-custodial wallet for bitcoin and Lightning, made a four-digit pin, and generated an invoice as a QR code. CNBC then captured that QR code using the scan mode in the Blue Wallet and transferred over 50,000 of sats from McCormack. The fees amounted to fractions of a penny. (For purposes of the experiment, Naumenko transferred another 50,000 because the bitcoin ATM had a minimum withdrawal amount.) Bitcoin developer Jeff Czyz tells CNBC that Lightning wallets are compatible because they all have to implement the Basis of Lightning Technology, or BOLT, specification, which defines a layer-2 protocol for sending payments across the Lightning Network. ""A Lightning wallet app is akin to a bank, in that sending money between banks requires them to speak the same language,"" said Czyz, a developer with Jack Dorsey's team known as Spiral (formerly Square Crypto). That common language is the BOLT specification. ""The Lightning Network consists of nodes connected by payment channels, which are used to forward payments across the network without the need to trust intermediaries,"" continued Czyz.

On April 13, Terra’s Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) acquired 2,508.94 bitcoin worth close to $100 million at the time of settlement. The purchase follows the 4,130 bitcoin LFG scooped up three days ago, and LFG’s wallet is now just over 495 bitcoin away from surpassing Tesla’s bitcoin treasury stash.
Luna Foundation Adds More Bitcoin to UST Reserve Wallet
LFG purchased another batch of bitcoin on Wednesday, adding to the non-profit’s bitcoin reserves meant to protect the Terra network’s stablecoin, UST. On April 13, 2022, at 1:55 a.m. (UST), the LFG bitcoin wallet scooped up another 2,508.94 bitcoin after acquiring 4,130 BTC three days ago. The purchase of 2,508.94 BTC was worth $99,914,270 using bitcoin exchange rates at the time of settlement.
After obtaining 2,508.94 BTC, the LFG bitcoin wallet now holds 42,406.92 BTC worth an estimated $1.79 billion. LFG’s wallet has seen a total of 68 transactions but has never sent a single satoshi out of the wallet. A myriad of dust transactions has been sent to the LFG wallet on a daily basis.
Currently, according to the bitcoin rich list, the LFG wallet is the 18th largest bitcoin wallet today. A great portion of the wallets above the LFG wallet in the bitcoin rich list are large cryptocurrency exchange cold wallets. For instance, the 15th largest bitcoin wallet today is an Okex exchange cold wallet with 45,820 BTC.
LFG Bitcoin Wallet Nears Tesla’s Treasury Stash, Terra’s Wallet Still Below Microstrategy’s and Block.one’s Cache of Bitcoins
The Luna Foundation Guard’s bitcoin wallet is getting awfully close to surpassing Tesla’s stash of 42,902 BTC. In fact, in order to jump above the electric car maker’s bitcoin treasury, LFG needs more than 495.08 BTC. If LFG’s wallet were to surpass the Tesla wallet, the LFG bitcoin reserve address would only be below Microstrategy’s cache of 125,051 BTC in terms of public companies.
In terms of private companies with bitcoin treasuries, LFG’s wallet is below Block.one’s stash of 140,000 bitcoin. Block.one is a blockchain software company that’s dedicated to the EOS network. Another private firm dedicated to a crypto ecosystem with a bitcoin treasury besides Terra and EOS, is the Tezos Foundation, which is focused on the Tezos network. The Tezos Foundation holds 17,500 bitcoin, according to bi-annual filings.
While LFG is hoarding bitcoin to leverage for reserves to protect the stablecoin UST, the organization also announced last week that it would diversify the UST forex reserves with avalanche (AVAX) tokens. LFG partnered with the Avalanche Foundation and explained it would purchase $100 million AVAX via an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. After LFG’s recent purchase, the price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped over 2% at 10:30 a.m. (EST) on Wednesday, to a high of $40,966 per unit on Bitstamp.

As of now, the address belonging to the LFG is already the third-largest single-wallet holder of Bitcoin.
Terra picked the world's largest cryptocurrency due to the fact that it has the most liquidity (by far), which is critical for ensuring the stability of the dollar peg.
Apart from Bitcoin, Terra has also added $100 million worth of Avalanche (AVAX) tokens for diversification purposes.
An $813 million gift
On Thursday, the LFG was gifted 10 million LUNA tokens (around $813 million at press time) by Terraform Labs.
While the designation of the funds is not clear for now, it is safe to assume that the nonprofit will use them to further increase its Bitcoin reserve.
The vast majority of the tokens were swapped for UST shortly after the transfer.
The LFT currently has $2.44 billion worth of reserves, with Bitcon accounting for 70% of the sum, according to its accounting records."

The largest camp includes investment firms and investors who add certain “safer” cryptocurrencies to their portfolios after expending a minimal level of due diligence. For them, the choice to purchase and hold cryptocurrency is based on “FOMO,” fear of missing out, and a recognition (and willing acceptance) that the risk/reward determination behind the investment is similar to buying lottery tickets. Somebody will win, the logic goes; it might as well be me. The other camps, the sizes of which are difficult to determine, have done sometimes extensive research and have concluded that cryptocurrencies are either: Skip advert A Ponzi scheme dependent on a steady influx of greater fools, A foolproof way to get rich if you only stick with it, or The future of financial exchanges when crypto eventually replaces fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, which is backed by a centralized federal banking system. They think cryptocurrency will provide completely decentralized financial transactions that free investors from the currency manipulations of sovereign nations and wealthy oligarchs. They also believe crypto’s blockchain technology will revolutionize privacy and security in numerous uses, from medical records to voting records.
Just describing the basics of cryptocurrency requires a vocabulary that easily obfuscates its reality. Purveyors of crypto investing have been accused of dismissing valid inquiries as petty ignorance by the intellectually inferior. This article will address some of the promises and issues related to crypto so you can decide the most important question: Is crypto investing worth your time and money? Understanding the basics There are three ways to acquire cryptocurrency: Skip advert After opening an online account, you can choose among a staggering number of cryptocurrencies to purchase through a brokered exchange. Your purchase and sale of the “coins” will look very similar to any other security, except that the market never closes and the price fluctuation is both highly volatile and completely untrustworthy. You can establish a “wallet” to hold crypto that you buy from someone else using one of many peer-to-peer online access points. This type of ownership carries much greater risks from price manipulation, scammers and a total lack of privacy (more on that later), but provides the free capitalist environment promised by an unregulated and decentralized exchange. Finally, you can create new coins for yourself by “mining” crypto. Every unit of a cryptocurrency, the “coin,” is the product of a created “block” (and every coin consists of a million smaller digital units). The block is created when someone, a “miner,” applies a significant investment in a series of highly sophisticated and interconnected computers and servers (the hardware alone may cost more than $12,000) and in computing power (sources report as much as 86,000 kWh in electricity expended per coin, costing as much as $5,000 in some states) to solve a puzzle that is automatically presented following the successful solution of the puzzle before it. Any number of miners attack the puzzle at the same time, and the miner who solves it first adds a “block” to the “blockchain” that evidences the coins the winner received for the solution. Blockchain puzzles get solved about every 10 minutes, and the difficulty level and coins won for each new puzzle are dependent on the number of miners who attempted the previous one. The blockchain is a digital ledger that cannot be altered, with each new block appended to the ledger in the order of its creation. The blockchain is available to anyone with the desire to download it and a server with enough memory to hold the entire chain. The blockchain is tested for accuracy through a “proof of work” protocol that verifies the blockchain by comparing the ledgers recorded across these numerous storage servers. If someone attempted to alter the blockchain to obtain cryptocurrency fraudulently, the redundant ledgers would uncover the attempt and discard the alteration. It is this decentralized system for tracking ownership of cryptocurrency that is supposed to provide confidence in its value. Skip advert
No one can say just how many such blockchain ledgers are stored for each cryptocurrency, how often attempts are made to introduce a fraudulent ledger or how such ledgers are sorted out if several different versions are created at once. Considering the cost and fragility of the hardware, the unavoidable occurrence of human error and negligence, and the already well-documented fraud and theft related to crypto, any confidence in this decentralized governance of its accuracy and valuation may be foolhardy. The limitations of crypto But let’s talk about the market for crypto. In spite of stories about a few countries and retailers accepting cryptocurrency, which have been debunked or proven insignificant, crypto may now only be exchanged for actual fiat currency or other digital assets in the form of “non-fungible tokens” or NFTs. We are a long way from establishing the market confidence in the value and stability of cryptocurrency necessary for it to be used for the purchase of goods and services, bypassing fiat money. And that’s the rub: There is no reason to believe that even the most exchanged cryptocurrency will ever achieve the price stability necessary for sellers to accept it. Today, there is no market for direct exchange of cryptocurrency, with purchases instead relying first on liquidation of the crypto to a fiat currency. Skip advert The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats crypto as a financial asset or property and will treat properly documented gains and losses in crypto liquidation just like other assets. You may note that the 2022 Form 1040 includes a question whether you have ever purchased crypto, even if you haven’t sold any. Which leads us back to privacy. Transactions in crypto are completely transparent to anyone sophisticated enough to review the blockchain. This digital trail will certainly be used by governments to track exchanges. It is already undeniable that crypto is being used in money laundering, ransomware attacks and other criminal activities to avoid federal banking oversight. Even if the blockchains are secure, other crypto repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, have been hacked, with reported losses in the millions of dollars.
Today’s crypto price volatility is absolutely untethered from any expectation of its use as currency. The volatility crypto owners experience now is the product of rumor and speculation. This is why some feel that cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme fueled by stories of sellers taking advantage of the huge price swings that occur when celebrity investors and billionaires engage in promotions or whenever a new record is set for a crypto purchase of digital art. In fact, the only way to make money on crypto is to sell out when others are heavily buying in, since the coins have no intrinsic value and aren’t tied to any production or services. The rise of NFTs Finally, about digital art. Today, we see many examples of blockchain technology being used to create non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. An NFT really is a token, a stand-in for any digital creation one may house there. It could be a photo in the form of a JPEG file, a video file, a text file (such as a contract, a deed to property, a single vote for a political candidate or a poem) or any number of other supposedly unalterable digital creations. The value of the NFT is not in any apparent uniqueness, since it can be readily copied, but in its actual uniqueness, because it is forever tied to its place in the blockchain. Skip advert However, an NFT only has the value one might exchange for it, either in other NFTs or in cryptocurrency coins. For example, if I buy a NFT digital artwork for one Bitcoin today (Bitcoin is trading as I type this at $38,686 per coin), then the seller could sell that coin immediately for dollars or could hold onto that coin in hopes it will trade higher later. For example, Bitcoin traded at about $67,000 per coin on Nov. 7, 2021, but also traded for about $29,000 per coin on July 19, 2021. What will it trade for next month? The Wild West All this is not to say that cryptocurrency as an investment and a method of exchange will or should be eliminated. Blockchain technology is an incredible advancement in the security and utility of information exchanges. Certain appropriate uses are already emerging. And investing in more speculative alternative assets is certainly an appropriate part of a diversified portfolio. But we’re in the Wild West of cryptocurrency today and, like the Western territories in American history in which intrepid homesteaders traced the paths of the explorers, one must consider the inherent risks faced by early adopters."
287,2022-04-15,2022-04-15,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Ryan Browne,www.cnbc.com,"North Korea linked to $615 million crypto heist, U.S. says","North Korean state-backed hacking collective Lazarus Group is linked to the theft of $615 million in digital assets, U.S. officials allege.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/15/ronin-hack-north-korea-linked-to-615-million-crypto-heist-us-says.html,"North Korean state-backed hacking collective Lazarus Group is linked to a massive cryptocurrency hack that led to the theft of $615 million in digital assets, U.S. officials allege.
The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control on Thursday announced new sanctions against an ethereum wallet belonging to Lazarus.
According to crypto researchers, the identified wallet contains funds related to an attack on the Ronin Network, which supports the popular blockchain game Axie Infinity. More than $600 million worth of ether and USDC tokens were stolen in the attack.
Hackers exploit what's known as a blockchain ""bridge,"" which allows users to transfer their digital assets from crypto network to another. Bridges are an increasingly popular tool in the rapidly-growing world of ""decentralized finance,"" or DeFi.
The newly announced sanctions prohibit U.S. individuals and entities from making transactions with the identified ethereum account to make sure the hackers can't ""cash out"" any funds they may hold with American crypto exchanges, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said in a blog post.
Chainalysis, another crypto research group, said the attribution to Lazarus highlights the importance of ""how DPRK-affiliated threat actors exploit crypto, and better security for DeFi protocols.""
Lazarus, which is believed to be operated by the North Korean state, has been associated with several major cyberattacks over the years, including a 2014 hack on Sony Pictures and the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks.
North Korea has attempted to use crypto as a way to evade U.S. sanctions on numerous occasions, according to cybersecurity experts, raising concerns about the possible use of digital assets for Russian sanctions evasion amid the Ukraine war.
Earlier this week, Virgil Griffith, a 39-year-old American crypto expert, was sentenced to five years in prison for helping North Korea use virtual currencies to evade sanctions.
Proponents of cryptocurrencies say they are an ineffective tool in laundering ill-gotten gains, since activity is recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain.
However, criminals have a number of techniques at their disposal to launder crypto, according to Elliptic. The company said internal analysis suggests the Ronin attacks ""managed to launder 18% of their stolen funds"" as of Thursday.
Hackers initially swapped stolen USDC tokens for ether through unregulated decentralized exchanges to prevent it from being seized, but then laundered almost $17 million of the proceeds through centralized exchanges like FTX and Huobi.
They subsequently used what's known as a ""mixer,"" a service that aims to obscure the trail of funds by mixing streams of potentially identifiable crypto transactions with others. More than $80 million has been sent through this mixing service, called Tornado Cash, according to Elliptic."

For Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, institutional BTC buying “might be the big narrative” in the crypto space once more.
Coinbase Pro shifts serious amounts of BTC
Ki highlighted figures from Coinbase Pro, the professional trading offshoot of United States exchange Coinbase, that confirm that large tranches of BTC continue to leave its books.
Those tranches totaled 30,000 BTC in a single day this week, and the event is not an isolated one, with March seeing similar behavior.

“30k BTC flowed out from Coinbase today,” he noted.
“Institutional buys might be the big narrative again because the Executive Order did not create any hurdle.”
Last month’s executive order from United States President Joe Biden, designed to investigate various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, has seemingly not deterred large-volume investors looking for exposure.

The trend is apparent across exchanges, as Cointelegraph reported this week, and April is currently attempting to match March in terms of overall outflows.
The reduction in supply contrasts with a troubling macro picture that continues to pressure risk assets, including crypto.
Bitcoin’s correlation to equities, themselves at the mercy of central bank policy, needs to break in order for conditions to improve, but analysts say that the process will be anything but smooth when it happens.
“Correlation breaks eventually — for multiple reasons,” commentator Dylan LeClair explained earlier this week.
“My guess: Eventually credit system breaks and volatility explodes. BTC follows but more because of deriv traders and not spot selling. BTC bears conditioned to fade every rally get rekt as spot supply continues to constrain.”
Terra keeps up the buying pressure
Meanwhile, the major buyer story of the year — that of blockchain protocol Terra — continues. The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), the nonprofit organization attached to Terra, has added around 2,633 BTC ($105.3 million) to its reserves over the past 48 hours.

Iran has drafted new rules to increase penalties for illegal cryptocurrency mining in the country, including additional fines and imprisonment. “Any use of subsidized electricity intended for households, industrial, agricultural, and commercial subscribers for mining cryptocurrency is prohibited.”
New Penalties for Illegal Cryptocurrency Mining in Iran
An official with Iran’s Power Generation, Distribution, and Transmission Company (Tavanir) said the country’s administration will approve new rules to increase penalties for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining, IRNA publication reported Sunday.
Mohammad Khodadadi Bohlouli explained that under the new law:
The increased penalties include raising fines by at least three and at most five times, imprisoning the offender, and revoking the offender’s business license.
“Any use of subsidized electricity intended for households, industrial, agricultural, and commercial subscribers for mining cryptocurrency is prohibited,” Khodadadi said.
The Iranian government approved cryptocurrency mining as an industry in 2019. In January 2020, the Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade issued over 1,000 licenses for cryptocurrency mining operations.
However, Iranian authorities said that some unauthorized miners are using household electricity for cryptocurrency mining, resulting in major issues for the country’s electricity industry. In December last year, crypto miners were ordered to halt operations to prevent winter blackouts. In September, the authorities reportedly confiscated over 220,000 mining machines and shut down nearly 6,000 illegal crypto mining farms across the country.

How to Use This Price Tracker Cryptocurrency pricing data can help investors find opportunities in the market and make more informed investment decisions. NextAdvisor’s price tracker shows historical price, trading volume, market capitalization, and other important metrics for investors, especially those who are just starting to dip their toes into crypto investing. While everyday investors probably don’t need every last bell and whistle to make informed investment decisions, there are some generally applicable key crypto metrics and indicators worth considering: Crypto Indicators and Metrics for Beginner Investors Price: As with any investment, price is where it starts and ends for investors. Pricing is highly volatile in cryptocurrency, but viewed over time can give investors an idea of how a given coin’s value has gone up (or down) over time. Market Capitalization: In general, the higher the value of the market cap the safer the investment. Market cap is the total value of a cryptocurrency, and is calculated by multiplying the price of the cryptocurrency with the number of coins in circulation. The amount of tokens or coins circulating can be viewed as an indicator of a coin’s demand. Volume: Higher volume typically means a given cryptocurrency has more market liquidity, meaning more ability for investors to sell an investment when they want to realize a profit. It represents how much crypto is bought and sold over a period of time, typically 24 hours.
If there’s one cryptocurrency you should know about, it’s bitcoin.
It’s the original and most valuable cryptocurrency by far, despite its huge — and normal — swings in recent months, ranging in value from less than $30,000 to more than $60,000. Bitcoin has also seen a surge of new investors, with more than half of all current bitcoin holders having bought in the past year.
“I invest in bitcoin for three reasons: One of them is that the supply is limited, the second is decentralization, and third, it is a category king,” says Kiana Danial, author of “Cryptocurrency Investing For Dummies” and an investing expert. “Everybody knows about bitcoin and immediately gives it this value.”
Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous figure under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto to function as an electronic peer-to-peer cash system, but has since attracted investors who view it as a store-of-value currency, sometimes described as digital gold. Bitcoin set the stage for blockchain technology and decentralized finance.
“Bitcoin by nature doesn’t really solve a problem,” says Danial. “It was just a showcase for decentralization.”
Based on those principles, the cryptocurrency market — which now consists of thousands of cryptocurrencies — has grown to a valuation of more than $2 trillion. While bitcoin has the longest record for investors to consider, it’s no less volatile.
What’s Driving Bitcoin’s Price?
Bitcoin fell below $20,000 Thursday as investors continue to flee from cryptocurrencies amid macroeconomic uncertainty.
“Bitcoin is under pressure and struggling to hold onto the $20,000 level,” says Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda. “If Bitcoin breaks below the recent low around $17,500, there isn’t much support until the $14,500 level.”
Over the last few months, bitcoin and stocks have largely remained under pressure as investors wrestle with rising inflation, geopolitical crises, and tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The crypto market is increasingly tracking the stock market lately, which combined with more mainstream adoption and the slumping prices starting the year, makes it even more intertwined with global economic factors, experts say.
In the short term, all these factors have created some noise and extra volatility in the crypto and stock markets, but this is usual during times of uncertainty. Volatility is standard in the cryptocurrency market, so experts predict the ups and downs to continue.
Bitcoin’s high point of the year so far remains in the earliest days of January, when it nearly hit $48,000. In that same month, bitcoin also hit its six-month low as it dipped below $34,000. Bitcoin has lost 40% of its value since its Nov. 10 all-time high above $68,000.
Bitcoin’s price has been between $19,000 and $22,000 this week. Here’s how its current price compares to its daily high point over the past few months:
One Week Ago (June 23) One Month Ago (May 30) 3 Months Ago (March 30) $21,100.27 $31,865.75 $46,270.20
So what should crypto investors do in light of this volatility? Nothing, according to the experts we’ve talked to. Given crypto’s history of volatility, this increase doesn’t guarantee a long-term reversal. Bitcoin’s price is just as likely to fall back down as it is to continue climbing. The future of cryptocurrency is sure to include plenty more volatility, and experts say that’s something long-term crypto investors will have to continue dealing with.
Bitcoin Predictions and the Future of Crypto
Bitcoin has shown as steady a rise in value over the years as any other cryptocurrency on the market, so it’s only reasonable for bitcoin investors to be curious about how high it can ultimately go.
Conservative predictions of bitcoin say the cryptocurrency will reach $100,000 by 2023, but more bullish crypto enthusiasts say $250,000 isn’t far from sight. Big financial institutions have made their own predictions as well, with JPMorgan seeing a long-term high of $146,000 and Bloomberg saying it could hit $400,000 by 2022. A recent study by Deutsche Bank found that about a quarter of bitcoin investors believe bitcoin prices will be over $110,000 in five years. Because bitcoin is so new, price predictions are mostly informed speculations.
What Bitcoin Investors Should Know
Bitcoin is a good place for beginner crypto investors to start, according to the experts we’ve talked to. But you shouldn’t invest in bitcoin just because others are doing it. More than anything, know what kind of investor you are and buy bitcoin only in a way that works with your long-term investment strategy.
If you’re investing in bitcoin, expect volatility. Just like you shouldn’t let a price drop influence your decision to buy bitcoin, don’t let a sudden price increase alter your long-term investment strategy. Even more importantly, don’t start buying more Bitcoin just because the price is rising.
Investors should continue to hold and not worry about the fluctuations. No matter if crypto is going up or down, the best thing you can do is to not look at it. Set it and forget it like you would any traditional long-term investment account. If you let your emotions get in the way, you could sell at the wrong time, or you might make the wrong investment decision.
How to Protect Your Bitcoin Investments
If you’ve incorporated bitcoin into your investment portfolio, here are some steps you can take to protect it:
1. Watch for Crypto Red Flags
There are some common red flags in crypto — similar to classic money wiring scams and credit card fraud — that you should keep an eye out for. They include:
Typographical errors and obvious misspellings in emails, on social media posts, and during any communication
Promises to multiply your money
Contractual obligations that lock you into holding crypto without being able to sell
Fake influencers or claims to be a celebrity
Psychological manipulation like blackmail or extortion
Large social media crypto schemes
Promises of free money
Vague details about where your money is going
2. Protect Your Digital Wallet
Another way to protect your bitcoin is to implement good digital security habits, similar to how you’d handle large sums of cash by putting them in a safe or FDIC-insured savings account. Experts say small-scale investors with a few hundred dollars in bitcoin are probably OK keeping it on a mainstream exchange like Coinbase. But if you have a significant amount of bitcoin, you can incorporate a crypto wallet for additional safekeeping. There are two types of crypto wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets.
Hot wallets are used to store crypto online. They are secure, but more susceptible to hacking than cold storage, which is when you store crypto offline on a piece of hardware. Think of cold storage as kind of like a safe in USB-drive format. It’s more secure, but if you forget your password or lose the device, you could lose access to your money forever.
Because crypto held in hot wallets is not FDIC-insured, you’ll want to make sure that whatever platform or wallet you store your crypto in has robust security measures, including:
Two-factor authentication
Storing a portion of holdings in its own cold storage
Private insurance policies in case of theft or hacking (separate from FDIC insurance)
3. Keep Track of Your Wallet Keys
You only get one unique key to access your wallet, which means you need to be extra careful about not losing your key or having it stolen. Don’t share your private key with anyone, just like you wouldn’t share your Social Security number or your debit card PIN. Maintaining strong passwords that you update regularly and not using the same password for multiple accounts will make you less vulnerable to hacks and scams.
4. Report Fraud
Report fraud and other suspicious activity to whatever crypto exchange you used to complete the crypto transaction and to the following bureaus using these links:
The FTC: ReportFraud.ftc.gov
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at CFTC.gov/complaint
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at sec.gov/tcr
If the fraud involves extortion or blackmail, you can also go to ​​the FBI
How to Buy Bitcoin
Once you’ve learned the lingo, accepted the risk, and met your other financial priorities, you’ll need to actually buy in. The process for buying bitcoin is the same as the process for buying any other altcoin.
First, you’ll want to choose a cryptocurrency trading platform to exchange your U.S. dollars for bitcoin or other digital currencies. Depending on the exchange you choose, you may need to provide information like your Social Security number, ID, and your source of income when you create your account. Once you’ve created your account, most exchanges will ask to connect your bank account or a debit card. That way, you can fund it with fiat currency, like U.S. dollars, to buy bitcoin. Once you’ve connected a payment method, you’ll be able to actually place your order for bitcoin. This process can differ depending on how advanced the exchange is.
Generally, if you’re using a beginner-friendly platform like Coinbase or PayPal, you can simply enter the amount in dollars you want to trade for bitcoin, and buy at the current rate (after accounting for any fees). If you use an exchange designed for more active trading, you may have the option to place both market and limit orders.
Lastly, make sure your crypto is stored safely. Many exchanges let you to leave your investment within your account, which is easiest for most beginners. But if you want to further secure your digital assets, you can transfer them into a hot or cold wallet.
How to Choose an Exchange
There are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges you can use to buy crypto online, but a few of the more popular ones are Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. These exchanges are online platforms where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies.
You can narrow down your search for the right platform by mostly paying attention to security and fees. If you plan to keep your crypto on your account with an exchange, make sure you choose an exchange that uses offline, cold storage, and has strong protections against theft. Some exchanges also have independent insurance policies to help protect investors from potential hacking.
Exchange fees can vary greatly, and may be applied as a flat fee upfront or as a percentage of your trades. Fees can be based on price volatility, and many are charged per transaction. While fees should definitely be a consideration, experts say you also get what you pay for, especially when sticking to the bigger, more established exchanges like Coinbase. If an exchange has more protections, better security, or other features that are important to you, it may be worth slightly higher fees.
The Best Exchanges for Crypto Trading
Cryptocurrency exchanges are a dime a dozen, but there are only a few we think make sense for crypto investors. The volatile, speculative nature of cryptocurrency investing presents risks for investors no matter how and where you buy it.
That’s why the safety of your investment should be a top priority when choosing a cryptocurrency exchange. The cryptocurrency exchanges that have been around the longest are usually a safer bet than newer ones. Here are our picks for the best crypto exchanges:
Coinbase: Good for beginners
Gemini: Good for experienced investors
eToro: Good for practicing crypto trading
Bitcoin Price History
Bitcoin has a much more extensive track record compared to other cryptos, though it’s still in its relative infancy compared to the 200+ year history of the U.S. stock market.
Bitcoin was created in 2009, with its first price being $0. By 2010, bitcoin’s first “big” jump happened. The price rose from a fraction of a cent in the spring to $0.09 by July. Very few people, except for very niche tech experts and finance enthusiasts, knew enough about bitcoin to buy the currency.
Bitcoin broke $1 in April 2011, entering its first mini “bull run” and rising by roughly 3,000% over the next three months. By November 2011, the price bottomed out again at $2. Bitcoin didn’t bounce back in 2012, finishing the year between $13 and $14. By November 2013, bitcoin broke $1,000 — then the price dropped dramatically by December to around $530. Between 2014 and 2016, bitcoin’s price was largely stagnant.
But thanks to media coverage and the steep rise in bitcoin’s price, the crypto industry started to take off between 2017 and 2019. At the start of 2017, bitcoin finally broke $1,000 again and kicked off a bull run phase. Prices doubled to $2,000 in mid-May and then skyrocketed to over $19,000 by December. By the end of 2019, bitcoin’s price was back down to $7,200.
At the start of 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic shut down the economy, bitcoin’s price started to accelerate in its upward climb. By December 2020, bitcoin’s price had increased by over 300% since January. The year ended at a price of about $29,374 — the highest it had ever been.
Bitcoin continued to grow in 2021, doubling its value. Bitcoin skyrocketed to an all-time high over $64,000 in the first half of 2021, then just as quickly fell back below $30,000 over the summer. Bitcoin hit another all-time high over $68,000 in November 2021, but by January 2022 had dropped back below $35,000. As of April 2022, bitcoin’s price hovers above $45,000.
Bitcoin vs. Ethereum
Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and exchange volume, but they’re very different when you look past the popularity they share.
Not only do they have technical differences, they also offer two completely different value propositions for investors, which could be the deciding factor for you. Many investors see bitcoin as a store of value, like gold, that can be used as a guard against inflation. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a software platform that allows developers to build other crypto-oriented apps on it. To use Ethereum, developers have to buy and pay fees to the network in Ethereum’s native digital currency, ether.
There are similar risks associated with both bitcoin and Ethereum, and the potential growth of either is highly speculative. Both are good options if you are just starting a crypto investment journey, and you could just split the difference and invest in both, experts say.
About Bitcoin
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and it is known as digital gold. Bitcoin is the most valuable crypto on the market, but is still highly speculative and volatile.
When Was Bitcoin Created?
The invention of the bitcoin currency (BTC) was simultaneous to the invention of bitcoin as a blockchain, and it was the first of its kind in history. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people, known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakamoto.
What Gives Bitcoin Its Value?
Bitcoin is valuable thanks to its limited supply steadily increasing demand by a greater number of investors. It has also been described by some as an inflation hedge.
Unlike investing in the stock market, with more predictable returns on investments like index funds, investing in bitcoin has been likened to investing in gold or other alternative assets such as art or horses. That’s because there’s a finite amount of bitcoin out there. While a company can issue more stock options, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. So even if the value of the dollar plummets, bitcoin, like gold, will retain a separate value in theory.
Bitcoin Market Cap
Bitcoin’s market capitalization is found by multiplying the current number of coins in existence — over 19 million — with bitcoin’s price at a given time. As bitcoin’s price fluctuates, which it does frequently, so too does its market capitalization. In the past few weeks, bitcoin’s price has been between around $34,000 to $47,000, which translates into a significant range in market capitalization:
$38,000 x 19 million = $722 billion
$42,000 x 19 million = $798 billion
$46,000 x 19 million = $874 billion
Frequently Asked Questions
Is Bitcoin still a good investment in 2022? Overall, bitcoin is considered a highly speculative and risky asset compared to conventional investments. While there is no guarantee you will get any of your money back, bitcoin has become the most valuable and commonly held among the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since been created. As the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has the longest record for investors to consider. The potential reward comes with higher risk, so make sure any investment in bitcoin is included in your broader portfolio’s riskier, more aggressive allocation. Will Bitcoin crash again? Bitcoin’s rise in value and popularity has been steady, if not without its ups and downs. But there are no guarantees when it comes to investing in crypto. As quickly as bitcoin falls, it can just as rapidly climb again. Volatility is the norm for crypto, mostly due to it being an immature market. There are also new regulations and policies that are constantly reshaping the market and causing drastic swings — and hype on social media. Do you pay taxes on Bitcoin? Yes, bitcoin is taxable.

The bitcoin price has bounced around $40,000 for most of 2022 as the bulls and the bears battle it out for control of the market. Meanwhile, the ethereum price has dropped under $3,000 per ether for the first time since mid-March.
The combined crypto market has lost almost $400 billion since early April, as top ten cryptocurrencies including Binance's BNB, Ripple's XRP, solana, cardano, luna and avalanche struggle—with analysts warning a ""disaster in the financial markets"" could push bitcoin under $30,000.

""The signal for a break of the mild upward trend would be a consolidation below the $38,000 per bitcoin levels,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, wrote in emailed comments. ""If the bulls capitulate, the first cryptocurrency could be pushed into the $32,o00 to $35,000 range without much resistance.""
The bitcoin and crypto sell-off comes as U.S. stock market futures declined ahead of the Monday's opening after a long holiday weekend, with investors bracing for a week of major first-quarter earnings reports and speeches by Federal Reserve policy-makers.
Last week, March's consumer price index reading showed an 8.5% increase from a year ago, the fastest annual gain since December 1981. Fed officials have promised to do whatever it takes to bring inflation under control, however, Goldman Sachs analysts have warned the Fed will struggle to cool inflation without causing a U.S. recession, putting the odds of the economy contracting at around 35% over the next two years.
""We are increasingly concerned about a summer of turbulence and volatility,"" Eric Robertsen, chief strategist at Standard Chartered, wrote in a note first reported by Bloomberg. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, puts the chance of a recession this year at 35%, ""but it’s not our base case,"" it was reported by Reuters. ""As concerns over an impending recession recede, I think the sponsorship of the defensives will recede with that,"" Hogan told the newswire.
""A consolidation scenario below $30,000 would require an absolute disaster in the financial markets,"" added Kuptsikevich.

The firm’s pair of ETFs are set to launch the same day as a fund proposed by Cosmos Asset Management, which intends to invest in shares of a Canadian bitcoin ETF
The first Australian ETFs to invest directly in bitcoin and ether are set to hit the market next week while US fund issuers continue to work with regulators to secure a listing.
Switzerland-based 21Shares, the world’s largest issuer of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), has teamed up with ETF Securities to launch the funds.
The ETFS 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (EBTC) and the ETFS 21Shares Ethereum ETF (EETH), which track the price of bitcoin and ether in Australian dollars, are fully backed by the respective assets held in cold storage by Coinbase.
Both ETFs are expected to list on the Cboe Australia exchange on April 27.
21Shares CEO Hany Rashwan told Blockworks the firm has been working to provide Australian investors easier access to crypto for years. Running the world’s longest-running spot bitcoin ETP, which launched in Switzerland in 2019, the firm has navigated everything “from contentious forks to stock splits,” he added.
“That valuable experience and deep data is consistently instrumental in all of our regulatory conversations,” Rashwan said. “There’s more to crypto than just bitcoin and ethereum, and we look forward to making the entire crypto world accessible and investable for everyone around the world.”
While ETFs investing directly in cryptoassets have launched across Europe, Canada and elsewhere, the products break new ground for Australia, whose regulators have previously viewed the digital assets as volatile and unfit for the country’s financial markets.
Some efforts from the country’s political elite signal a willingness to work constructively with crypto proponents in a bid to usher in a new age for Australian investors backed by appropriate legal frameworks.
Those promises are being bolstered by attempts to push the country’s forward-thinking approach toward greater digital asset adoption including the private sectors’ experimentation with the nascent asset class.
Last month, Australia’s ANZ Bank became the first major financial institution in the country to issue and execute payment of a stablecoin linked to the nation’s dollar. A green light from the country’s primary clearing house marks yet another step along Australia’s journey to crypto adoption.
Indeed, the Australian Financial Review reported Tuesday that Cosmos Asset Management would launch the country’s first bitcoin ETF on April 27. Instead of direct spot exposure, Cosmos’ fund is expected to invest in crypto through Purpose Investments’ bitcoin ETF — which launched on Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2021.
21Shares has roughly $2.5 billion in assets under management. Its products are listed on 10 regulated European exchanges.
“Once we decided to build a range of crypto ETFs for the Australian market, there was only one partner we wanted to work with,” Graham Tuckwell, executive chairman of ETF Securities Australia, said in a statement. “[21Shares’] pioneering approach to secure investment in cryptocurrency has been emulated by other fund managers around the world.”
21Shares has launched a handful of ETPs this year, including products with Aave (AAVE), Chainlink (LINK) and Uniswap (UNI) as their underlying assets. Rashwan previously told Blockworks that the firm aims to support what it considers to be the top 50 cryptocurrencies by the end of the year.
The pending launches come as the SEC continues denying spot bitcoin ETF proposals from US fund issuers. Crypto firm executives remain split on when exactly such a product could be approved.

Australia is set to get its first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) after a report suggested the country’s clearinghouse, ASX Clear, confirmed that four market participants agreed to meet its stringent margin requirements.
ASX Clear’s Margin Requirements
An Australian clearinghouse controlling access to the country’s equity capital markets, ASX Clear, is expected to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), a report has said. The thumbs up to what is said to be Australia’s first bitcoin ETF became possible after three institutional participants and one retail participant reportedly agreed to the clearinghouse margin requirements.
According to an AFR report, the four participants agreed to provide ASX Clear’s required margin of 42% before it allowed trading in the ETF. The report said this requirement was needed in order to cover the settlement risks that are associated with bitcoin.
“We are now at our minimum number of clearing participants and that means we are good to go,” Hamish Treleaven, the CEO of ASX Clear is quoted explaining.
The CEO added that the clearinghouse will consequently issue a notice that gives market participants seven days’ notice of ASX Clear’s regulatory approval. The notice, according to the report, is intended to give brokers, clearers, investors and market makers time to prepare for the ETF.
The Cosmos Asset Management bitcoin ETF will be the only bitcoin ETF product available when trading commences on the Cboe trading venue on April 27, the report said. There are expectations that $1 billion will roll into the bitcoin ETF once it is listed.
The Regulator’s About-Face
Meanwhile, the report noted that the approval of the bitcoin ETF had come some two years after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) ruled out listing a crypto ETF in the country. However, the regulator would later shift its position after it was pressured by the country’s politicians, the report said.
As noted in the report, the approval of Cosmos Asset Management bitcoin ETF likely means other trading venues such as NSX might also list a bitcoin ETF.

BTC's correlation with gold is at a low point.,https://decrypt.co/98201/bitcoin-is-trading-like-tech-stock-not-digital-gold,"What looks like a tech stock and acts like a tech stock but isn't a tech stock? The answer, increasingly, is Bitcoin—at least when it comes to its market value.
The price of the cryptocurrency is more correlated with share prices on the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock index than at any point since July 2020. According to a new report from Arcane Research, the 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and Nasdaq is 0.70.
Correlation is measured on a -1 to 1 scale, where -1 means the prices always move in opposite directions and 1 means they are in perfect synchronization. A 30-day correlation smooths out some of the day-to-day noise by using a longer time horizon.
While Bitcoin is increasingly correlated with risk assets like Google and Tesla stocks, it's moved into a negative correlation with gold. It's -0.45 is right around an all-time low point. In August 2020, BTC-to-gold hit an all-time high, though the pair has historically fluctuated between positive and negative correlations, providing little guidance to market speculators.
Correlation between Bitcoin, Nasdaq, gold
The price of gold has traveled from $1,805 per ounce at the beginning of 2022 to $1,952 today, per data from Monex; it's remained roughly static over the past month. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin has gone from $46,730 in value to $41,326, according to data from CoinMarketCap; it's also even for the month, but has experienced sharper volatility than gold.
Ironically, Bitcoin is often referred to as ""digital gold"" because some proponents see it as a hedge against inflation.
Inflation is certainly at play in today's markets. The most recent U.S. Consumer Price Index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, put annual inflation at 8.5%—the highest it's been since Ronald Reagan's first term. That means that consumer items cost more than they did a year ago; the dollar doesn't go as far.
Neither, it seems, do Bitcoin or equities. After a stellar 2021, the Nasdaq is down 13% on the year. No surprise that that's almost the same as Bitcoin, which has lost nearly 12% of its value."

That will allow the product to start trading on April 27. The Cosmos fund invests in crypto through the Purpose Bitcoin ETF that listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange last November.
There is speculation of $1 billion in inflows when the ETF goes live in Australia next week, the newspaper reported.

This is a new form of digital money where users can convert their traditional money like the U.S. dollar digitally and purchase items in the digital economy. In recent years cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin have started permeating into mainstream trading with businesses like Microsoft, Home Depot, Starbucks, Whole Foods, AT&T, and Amazon accepting cryptocurrencies.
What Exactly is Cryptocurrency?
What is cryptocurrency? Simply put a cryptocurrency is any form of digital currency that exists digitally or virtually, secured through cryptography making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. They do not have a regulating or central body but are distributed digitally across a large number of computers known as blockchains. Like paper money, cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies that can be used for real-world applications such as making payments, transferring funds, or even making speculations on the prices of other cryptocurrencies and Nonfungible Tokens (NFT).
You can even create your own cryptocurrency. Creating a new cryptocurrency does however require some computer coding expertise, but you also can opt to go through the short route by hiring a blockchain developer to create your very own virtual currency. Launching your own cryptocurrency on an existing blockchain platform like Ethereum can be done.
How Cryptocurrency Works
Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that work outside the banking system and are not controlled by any government or central regulatory authorities. Cryptocurrencies are issued on blockchains where ownership of a particular cryptocurrency is determined by holding a private key and using the private key to make crypto purchases or transfers. At the backend cryptocurrencies like the Bitcoin network relies on miners to maintain their network. Cryptocurrency mining operations entail solving complex computations for providing authentications and verifying transactions that help blockchains to run smoothly. Bitcoin mining helps record current bitcoin transactions in blocks, which are then added to a blockchain. Bitcoin miners use software to solve transaction-related issues such as checking and verifying bitcoin transactions.
Every cryptocurrency has a blockchain supporting it, which is a public ledger made up of blocks of transactions. Bitcoin protocol requires proof of work, where each block of transactions is designated with a specific hash. For the block to be confirmed, a crypto miner must generate a target hash that’s less than or equal to that of the block. Bitcoin miners offer indispensable support to the operations of blockchain and in return are often rewarded with newly created cryptocurrencies and transaction fees.
Blockchain Technology
Blockchains are a form of public ledgers, which is a series (or chain) of blocks on which transactions are recorded after suitable authentication and verification by miners. They are distributed across computers that run using blockchain technology. Here no single entity owns or controls the database, and anyone can access the database, offer proof of ownership, and transfer cryptocurrencies through the use of crypto wallets. The popularity of cryptocurrency has led to the spawning of thousands of cryptocurrencies with a global cryptocurrency market now valued at almost $2 trillion.
How You Can Use Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrencies help digital payment systems that don’t rely on banks to verify transactions. This peer-to-peer system helps to enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments electronically. Instead of using physical money by carrying it around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital currencies that can be exchanged through digital wallets or crypto exchanges. When users transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in public ledgers on blockchains instantly. Like real money cryptocurrencies have their own uses and include:
Use cryptocurrencies for everyday needs: Cryptocurrencies have crossed over into mainstream trade where users can use cryptocurrencies to purchase everyday items both online and in person. Cryptocurrency ecosystems allow for easy transferring of funds across the globe enabling unrestricted global commerce seamlessly. If you want to spend cryptocurrency at a retailer that doesn’t accept it directly, you have the option to use a cryptocurrency debit card. You can also send or receive cryptocurrency as a form of payment as well.
Engage in NFT trading: Cryptocurrencies help users engage in the trading of NFTs which are digital collectibles. They can use NFTs to sustain their hobby, support their idols or speculate in the lucrative NFT market.
Create NFTs: With cryptocurrencies, users can create their unique digital art, music, and in-game collectible to sell. These are limited edition and one-of-a-kind digital art that has disrupted the art world.
Support charities and causes: Cryptocurrencies can help users make donations or support causes that they are passionate about. Charitable organizations such as the Red Cross, UNICEF, and Greenpeace now accept cryptocurrencies.
Pay bills: being able to pay your bills with cryptocurrencies depends on where you live. Some nations are gradually allowing cryptocurrencies to be used as an alternative to their currencies while other nations such as El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as their legal tender.
Speculate in the cryptocurrency market: With cryptocurrencies being a craze these days many have started speculating on the prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as a side hustle. Another savvy investment is to look for initial coin offerings and be part of the action early that can potentially yield some good returns over time.
How to Invest in Cryptocurrency
There are a lot of cryptocurrencies in the market some are universally accepted while others serve specific purposes. Before buying your cryptocurrencies, you will need to do the following:
1. Research: It’s important that you keep yourself abreast with the world of cryptocurrencies. You will need to do extensive research, read reviews, and follow market trends before settling on a particular cryptocurrency.
2. Choose a crypto exchange, payment services, or cryptocurrency brokerage services: These help currency owners to facilitate the purchase of cryptocurrencies. With these, you deposit your US dollar and exchange it for your desired cryptocurrency.
3. Create a cryptocurrency exchange account: For you to trade using cryptocurrencies you will need a cryptocurrency to help you facilitate the authentication and transaction processes. To create an account, you will need to sign up and add a payment method that could be a bank account or a credit or debit card that can be used as a mechanism for deposits and withdrawals for your crypto account.
4. Deposit money into your account: After opening a crypto exchange account, you’ll need to make sure you have funds in your account. You will need to deposit money into your crypto account by linking your bank account, authorizing a wire transfer, or even making a payment through your debit or credit card.

Storing Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency holders will need a cryptocurrency wallet or digital wallet to store their crypto funds and cryptocurrency data. Cryptocurrency wallets help to secure your cryptocurrency holdings as they keep your private keys or password which is a randomly generated string of alphanumeric characters that act like your bank PIN. Your digital wallet will give you access to your cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets while preventing others from using your crypto or tampering with it. Looking for a crypto wallet? check out our article 8 Best Cryptocurrency Wallet Options.
Pros of Crypto Transactions
Cryptocurrency transactions come with several benefits and include:
1. Speed: cryptocurrency transactions offer you the advantage of trading in real-time making transactions happen within minutes. Once the blockchain has confirmed the authenticity of your account and verifies you have sufficient funds, transactions are automated.
2. Relative low transaction costs: The cost of transacting in cryptocurrency is relatively low compared to other financial services.
3. Easy access to your account: Cryptocurrency transactions offer users the ability to make transactions through their mobile devices or computers. With your computer or smartphone and an internet connection, you can conduct and verify transactions 24/7.
4. Security: Cryptocurrencies are encrypted, meaning it is the users only that have the private keys to their crypto wallets so they are the only ones that can manage their funds. Make sure to keep your private key a secret.
5. Offer privacy: The fact that you don’t have to register for an account at financial institutions to transact with cryptocurrency means you can maintain a level of privacy. A cryptocurrency public ledger keeps users’ identities anonymous along with their cryptocurrency balances, and a record of all transactions executed between network participants. Users can make transactions by using pseudonymous and keeping their anonymity.
Cons of Crypto Transactions
Despite their advantages, cryptocurrencies do also come with risks and these include:
Environment impact: Minting cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency transactions come with a significant computing process requiring massive amounts of energy.
Price volatility: Cryptocurrency prices are subject to volatility potentially exposing you to risks of losing money.
Possible legal ramifications: Because cryptocurrencies are a relatively new phenomenon governments have yet to make any concrete legislation governing their usage. On that latter point, cryptocurrencies run on a decentralized system and as such cannot fall under the domain of a single jurisdiction causing legal quandaries when it comes to taxes and money laundering.
Bitcoin Vs. Cryptocurrency Transactions
Bitcoin is considered the first cryptocurrency and was created in 2009. Today it is by far the most well-known crypto token in the market that you can buy. This popular cryptocurrency started as a peer-to-peer digital currency. It is the largest cryptocurrency in circulation and its blockchain technology handles bitcoin cash transactions through a decentralized network without any third party to facilitate trading. Besides offering relatively low transaction fees and many crypto exchanges accept Bitcoin. In addition, it is inflation-proof as it is capped at 21 million coins and has seen its value increasing exponentially with Bitcoin owners reaping rewards.
If you decide to invest in cryptocurrencies, try to start with a popular cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, as newer ones may not have sufficient liquidity offering when you want to sell the cryptocurrencies off. Another savvy investment is to look for an initial coin offering that can potentially yield some good returns over time.
Is cryptocurrency worth it?
Seeing the popularity of cryptocurrencies many crypto companies have cropped up. With over $91.5 billion in daily transactions across 455 crypto exchanges, 154 counties, and 120 million Bitcoin transactions there is money to be made with cryptocurrencies. As such, many are looking to invest in cryptocurrency. Some cryptocurrencies held on cryptocurrency exchanges or wallets come with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -insurance similar to money deposited in banks helping to ease concerns over losses. For more insights check out our article How to Sell Cryptocurrency.
Is cryptocurrency legal?
Cryptocurrency regulation has been the focus of both the Federal and state governments. The Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Services, and other government bodies have their own modalities when it comes to dealing with cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Determining a central authority when it comes to a specific cryptocurrency transaction can be confusing, however when it comes to what services and exchanges you can use and what you can use it for might depend on the particular state you reside in. Issues regarding, do you have to pay taxes on cryptocurrency or how to accept crypto payments remain in debate.
Is cryptocurrency safe?
Investing in cryptocurrencies can be a risky venture due to their price volatility, crypto data getting lost or stolen, and questions of their legality in certain jurisdictions. However, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity and are becoming mainstream. Some financial institutions are even offering insurance for crypto while some cryptocurrencies are pegged at par with real currencies such as the US dollar to mitigate volatility issues.
What are cryptocurrency exchanges?
Cryptocurrency exchanges act as a cryptocurrency market. They are platforms where users can sell and buy cryptocurrencies, and trade one crypto for another. You can also buy digital assets such as NFTs, convert Bitcoin to Ethereum and cryptocurrencies back into their dollars or another currency, or buy crypto using standard currency.

In Africa, there is no established framework for cryptocurrency education. However, a few key players have been observed to have a significant impact in raising Bitcoin awareness and understanding. This includes everything from foundations to cryptocurrency exchanges, individuals, and private companies.
Africans primarily use social media sites such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram to learn about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They also obtain information from books, blog articles, and exchange resources provided by industry leaders such as Binance, Paxful, Luno, and Coinbase. The majority of African media companies do not promote Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies for fear of repercussions from their regulators, as well as bans and embargoes imposed by central banks.
Looking at a longer term view, some organizations are building schools while others are developing learning materials for schools. One notable leader in this is Yusuf Nessary, co-founder and director of Built With Bitcoin Foundation. He has built schools in Kenya, Rwanda, and Nigeria in partnership with Paxful and other players.
SHAmory, a company that creates Bitcoin-themed fun games and books, is also a major player in Africa. The SHAmory family believes that there are no barriers for anyone in the world to use the Bitcoin network, and their mission is to bridge the generation gap. Their products are designed to teach children of all ages about Bitcoin and its features in a fun and engaging manner.
According to Gemini's 2022 Global State of Crypto report, education is the most significant global barrier to crypto ownership. According to the study, 40% of African respondents had not purchased any cryptocurrency because they did not understand how to buy and hold. Other barriers to Bitcoin adoption included a lack of trust and apprehension about Bitcoin price volatility.
The lack of education is making Africa a ripe target for crypto scammers from all around the world. These crypto scams range from ponzi schemes promising to give lucrative returns to DeFi projects promising to deliver above-market returns on staked tokens and yield farming. This is eroding the element of trust which is required for wider adoption.
For example, in 2021, the founders of Africrypt, a defunct crypto investing platform, stole over $3.6 billion in Bitcoin in South Africa. Because cryptocurrencies are not recognized as financial assets in South Africa, the regulatory authority has no grounds to prosecute. This is one of several cryptocurrency scams that have occurred in Africa in the last two years. This raises concerns about the security of cryptocurrency projects in Africa, raising the bar for wider adoption.
Binance and other players have been organizing educational programs to help Africans understand crypto, protect their crypto, and avoid crypto scams in order to slow the spread of crypto scams in Africa. Binance sponsored a 400-person program in Nigeria this year to educate students from the Federal University of Technology Minna. Binance claims that it has educated over 541,000 Africans about cryptocurrency.
The most significant impediment to Bitcoin adoption in many parts of Northern Africa is the existence of strict regulations prohibiting the use of cryptocurrencies, while others prohibit banks from dealing with crypto firms. According to a 2021 study by the Law Library of Congress, all use of private cryptocurrencies is prohibited in Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria.
Satoshicentre, one of Africa's oldest Bitcoin companies, began crypto education in Botswana in 2014. Satoshicentre hasn't scaled much because the Botswana government hasn't implemented digital currency regulation, so it's forced to accelerate crypto adoption through peer-to-peer transactions. With the current legal framework, obtaining a license for a crypto exchange in Botswana is difficult.
Satoshicentre collaborated with Paxful last year to create a hub for blockchain startup acceleration and innovation. The collaboration aims to educate Motswana about blockchain, support their blockchain startups, and connect them with investors to help them scale.
To truly scale Bitcoin adoption in Africa, the crypto community's leaders must find a way to educate politicians and other policymakers about Bitcoin and its features. As a result, they will no longer be afraid of Bitcoin and will embrace its ability to facilitate the transfer, storage, and protection of value. When these policymakers understand and embrace Bitcoin, the chances of passing Bitcoin-friendly legislation and regulations increase.
Furthermore, Bitcoin plebs in Africa must accelerate blockchain education in order to help people understand crypto and secure their coins. This will slow the spread and impact of cryptocurrency scams while also restoring trust in blockchain projects. It will also speed up crypto adoption because most blockchain education programs end up orange-pilling their students.

Strike integrating with the BlackHawk network allows bitcoin to enter the physical locations of shops and restaurants which still make up 85% of U.S. transactions.
Low transaction costs and merchant adoption will likely lead to less volatility in the chosen asset over time, Morgan Stanley reportedly stated.
Morgan Stanley, one of the largest global banks in the world, recently stated that bitcoin has reached an important milestone to be more widely used as a currency, according to a report from CoinDesk.
The report states that Strike, a fintech payment processor for the Bitcoin Lightning Network, integrating with BlackHawk Network, the largest payment processor in the world, paves the way for bitcoin to cement itself as a medium of exchange.
Morgan Stanley reportedly said that the “evolution of bitcoin usage as a medium of payment” will be fueled by the ability of consumers to choose paying with BTC through Lightning in physical locations, rather than only being able to use the peer-to-peer (P2P) currency online.
The banking giant further explained that sending small payments is more practical with Lightning than with debit cards as the Bitcoin second-layer network can route transactions while charging almost no fees.
Low transaction fees and open accessibility make adoption easier for merchants, which Morgan Stanley thinks will lessen the burden of volatility as the continued acceptance of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a means of payment might lead to a fall in their volatility, according to the report.
Strike CEO Jack Mallers announced the company’s integration with BlackHawk at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in a riveting presentation of monetary history and its lack of innovation over the last few decades.
One interesting component of this integration is that Strike leverages Bitcoin, the network, to allow merchants to never touch bitcoin, the asset, as a means of payment. As a result, the consumer can spend their BTC while the merchant receives dollars with nearly zero fee deduction and at the same time doesn’t need to worry with additional accounting requirements."

Elon Musk made waves in early 2021 when he announced that Tesla was buying $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and accepting the world’s most popular cryptocurrency as payment for its vehicles — yet another first for Musk in the auto industry.
The revolution was short-lived.
What is often left out of the discussion about bitcoin is how terrible it is for the environment. The powerful, specialized computers that are needed to mine bitcoin gobble up enormous amounts of energy, which is why most of it is mined in China, where electricity is dirt cheap and regulations are lax. Tesla — a company whose entire brand is rooted in sustainable energy — dropped its bitcoin bid about three months later. Musk cited environmental concerns and the huge volume of fossil fuels that must be burned to produce a single coin. On May 12, 2021, Musk’s mea culpa wiped $365 billion from the cryptocurrency market in a single day.
But not all companies share Musk’s concern with green energy. Bitcoin is big and getting bigger, with some of the biggest corporations in America jumping on the bandwagon and accepting bitcoin as payment. Here are the top 10 players in the game.
Microsoft
Microsoft became an early adopter of bitcoin in 2014 when it began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment to buy games, apps and other digital content in the Microsoft Store for platforms like Windows Phone and Xbox.
Make Your Money Work Better for You
Bitcoin was still largely unknown in 2014, and many of those who were familiar heard about it for all the wrong reasons. It was a year of drama and scandal, with the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsing into bankruptcy after a flurry of frauds, hacks and incidents that saw hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins lost.
At that time, a bar in New York City accepted bitcoin, so did a few car services and restaurants, but very few other major companies to speak of — except for two.
PayPal
If anyone was going to beat Microsoft to the punch, it makes sense that it would be the company that blazed the trail for modern digital payments. Microsoft began accepting bitcoin in December 2014 — three months after PayPal got on board in September.
Back then, bitcoin was trading as XBT instead of BTC. As a testament to how unfamiliar the concept was then, CNN described bitcoin as “an independent, government-less currency.” PayPal’s move was intended to draw businesses, not consumers, to its platform. The draw was that bitcoin’s transaction fees were far lower than the profit-killing 2%-3% charge that businesses were paying for credit card transactions.
Make Your Money Work Better for You
Whereas the initial foray into cryptocurrency allowed merchants to accept bitcoin payments from customers, PayPal has only recently allowed customers to check out with crypto in the same way they do with other payment methods, using the PayPal wallet. “Checkout with Crypto” automatically converts cryptocurrency to fiat currency with no integrations or extra fees required by the business, according to a press release PayPal issued last March. Transactions occur using U.S. dollars.
Overstock
Before PayPal and Microsoft went crypto, Overstock.com was blazing the trail that those giants would follow. As early as 2018, CNN was reporting that Overstock was “basically a crypto company now,” an exaggeration based on the online retailer’s heavy investment in blockchain technology.
By that time — before COVID-19 boosted Overstock to its current status as one of the hottest e-commerce platforms in the world — it was already a bitcoin veteran. In January 2014 — a full nine months before PayPal took the plunge and nearly a year before Microsoft — Overstock became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin as payment, although it doesn’t yet accept bitcoin on its mobile site. Note, however, that the only payment methods you can use in combination with bitcoin are Overstock gift cards, store credit, Club O rewards and coupons.
Make Your Money Work Better for You
Whole Foods
In May 2019, a cryptocurrency dam broke when a payments startup called Flexa joined forces with Gemini, a digital currency company owned by the Facebook-famous Winklevoss twins. The partnership’s platform allowed big retailers to incorporate Flexa into the digital scanners they were already using to accept phone-based payments through Apple Pay and other digital wallets. The technology instantly converted bitcoins into dollars for seamless purchases. One of the first of those big retailers to adopt the technology was Whole Foods.
Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, but Amazon itself does not, as of now, accept bitcoin for purchases made through the world’s largest online retailer. Not directly, at least. You can purchase or redeem an Amazon gift card with a wallet like BitPay along with a Coinbase account. You use the account to fund the wallet, and then use the wallet to buy or spend your gift card.
Etsy
Etsy itself doesn’t have a platform for accepting bitcoin as payment sitewide, but the independent sellers who populate its platform can accept cryptocurrency in their individual shops if they choose to employ a workaround. It’s up to the seller to add an “other” payment method option at checkout. When buyers click that option, they’ll be able to message the buyer with their payment preferences — bitcoin, in this case. The seller then responds with a bitcoin address to complete the transaction.
The Etsy Community forum has a special page dedicated to bitcoin, with tutorials that explain how sellers can advertise that they accept bitcoin and how to make the process go smoothly. There’s also a “Bitcoin Accepted” page on the Etsy site that makes it easy for buyers to find bitcoin-friendly merchants.
Starbucks
In March 2020, just as masks began covering faces across America and the world, Starbucks announced it was joining the bitcoin revolution — kind of.
Like Etsy, Starbucks dipped its toes in the water instead of diving right into accepting cryptocurrency as cash. You can’t pay for your frappuccinos with bitcoin at the register, but you can add bitcoin — along with things like gift card balances and frequent-flyer miles — to the Starbucks app and pay that way. The upgrade was made possible by a third-party digital wallet app called Bakkt that converts bitcoin to dollars to make payments not just possible, but instantaneous.
Newegg
Online electronics giant Newegg accepts bitcoin — and it has gone all in. Unlike some of the others that require you to convert cryptocurrency to cash through an app or third-party service, Newegg just lets you pay outright. For shoppers who are buying through a computer, all they have to do is choose “Pay With Bitcoin” and go through the motions of shipping. For shoppers making purchases with their phones, Newegg will send a QR code to scan.
For anyone who’s looking to get started harvesting bitcoins on their own, Newegg also sells cryptocurrency mining starter kits.
Home Depot
Home Depot, too, is using the Winklevoss/Flexa system — the same one that allowed Whole Foods to accept bitcoin through its own digital scanners without investing in new hardware.
Retailers have to submit balance sheets in dollars no matter what form of payment they accept, which was long a big stumbling block for companies that wanted to accept bitcoin but didn’t know how. Flexa converts bitcoin to dollars instantaneously, which gives both parties what they want. The buyer gets to spend their bitcoins when they buy their paint and Ryobi tools, and Home Depot gets the green dollars they require in exchange.
Rakuten
Japanese cash-back/shopping site Rakuten began letting users choose bitcoin as a payment option in 2015. As part of a global bitcoin rollout, the company started with Rakuten.com in the U.S. before expanding the new service to its counterparts in Germany and Austria. Rakuten made it possible by integrating the Bitnet payment processing platform into its own marketplaces.
It has since developed Rakuten Wallet, which offers a spot trading service and also supports altcoins like bitcoin cash and ethereum. Users can now charge their Rakuten Cash balance using crypto assets.
Twitch
Twitch is the 800-pound gorilla on the streaming video platform block. Like Whole Foods, Twitch is owned by Amazon. Also like Whole Foods, it now accepts cryptocurrency — and not just bitcoin. Users can pay in bitcoin, but also bitcoin cash and ether, as well as lesser-used coins like BUSD, PAX, GUSD, USDC and XRP.
Fun Fact Twitch was one of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrency, adding it as a payment option in 2014. That ended in 2019, when Twitch quietly removed its bitcoin service. In June 2020, however, Twitch brought that capability back, to the delight of its crypto-conscious users.
CheapAir.com
CheapAir.com customers could use bitcoin to pay for flights as early as 2013. These days, you can use bitcoin to pay CheapAir.com directly for both hotels and airfare over the btc network, or you can pay with a number of other cryptocurrencies using a compatible wallet. CheapAir.com accepts bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, dogecoin, gemini, USD coin, paxos standard, BUSD, dai and wrapped BTC, according to its website.
AMC Theatres
In a massive push to join the 21st century, AMC Theatres began accepting not just Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal payments, but cryptocurrency payments as well — at least for online purchases. Theatergoers can pay using bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, according to a tweet from AMC CEO Adam Aron.
AT&T
AT&T was the first major mobile carrier in the U.S. to accept bitcoin. Although you can’t make direct payments, you can pay your bill through BitPay. Just select BitPay as your payment option when you log into your account from a computer or from the myAT&T app.
Dish Network
Dish also uses BitPay to process payments. It made the switch in 2018, allowing customers to pay in bitcoin or bitcoin cash for the first time. You can use either cryptocurrency to make one-time payments on MyDish.com or using the Hopper DVR, but you have to use the exact amount needed to pay your bill.

A document obtained through a freedom of information request reveals the measures that European Union officials have considered to help curb Bitcoin’s energy use. In addition to demanding the top cryptocurrency switch to a Proof-of-Stake validation mechanism, the document indicates an outright ban on trading is also on the cards.
EU Officials on Bitcoin
EU officials don’t like Bitcoin, new documents have revealed.
Digital rights organization Netzpolitik published a report Thursday highlighting the extent of anti-Bitcoin talks among European Union officials. Several documents obtained through freedom of information requests reveal how far discussions on banning Bitcoin mining and trading in the EU have progressed.
One document containing the minutes from an EU meeting with Sweden’s financial supervisor and environmental agency discussed the growth of Bitcoin mining in the country. One speaker asked whether authorities could pressure Bitcoin to transition to the less energy-intensive Proof-of-Stake validation mechanism. The document stated:
“If Ethereum is able to shift, we could legitimately request the same from BTC. We need to ‘protect’ other crypto coins that are sustainable. Don’t see [the] need to ‘protect’ the Bitcoin community.”
In the same meeting, another speaker bluntly asked whether the EU should put a blanket ban on trading crypto assets based on Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work algorithm. Although the answer to this question was redacted to protect the “ongoing decision-making process,” it highlights that such measures were clearly under consideration.
However, the most damning statement came towards the end of the meeting as officials discussed the consequences of a possible ban on investors. “How would [the] disappearance of Bitcoin affect consumers?” asked one person involved. “Participants in BTC are fully aware of the volatility of the currency/investment risk. Do not need additional protection measures,” was written in response.
Those involved in the discussion appear unconcerned with the thousands of individuals around the world for whom Bitcoin acts as a lifeline. From Ukrainians using cryptocurrencies to help them flee war to Argentinians investing in Bitcoin to escape inflation, the EU seems to disregard the benefits of Bitcoin’s decentralized, peer-to-peer payments system while instead focusing solely on its energy usage.
The fundamental lack of understanding of cryptocurrencies was further highlighted when one person involved questioned, “Which service does Bitcoin offer that Solana does not offer to society? If you can prove that other cryptocurrencies can operate without Proof-of-Work then why can’t Bitcoin?”
For all the benefits Solana offers, it is far more centralized than Bitcoin, operating mainly under the control of the Solana Foundation. On the other hand, Bitcoin is much more decentralized, allows excess energy to be converted to a valuable asset, and offers a more reliable and uncensorable means to trade value peer-to-peer.
This same lack of understanding manifests in calls to “change the code,” referring to a recent Greenpeace campaign to get Bitcoin to switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. While this mantra is popular among EU politicians and environmental organizations, these groups fail to understand that Bitcoin is not heavily influenced by any single entity like Solana. There is no group you can lobby to bend Bitcoin to your will; it’s a decentralized network of individual actors.
While eye-opening, the document released by Netzpolitik today covers a meeting held in November 2021. Since then, the EU Parliament has voted against legislation calling for a ban on Proof-of-Work mining. However, the document gives valuable insight into some EU officials’ approaches to regulating Bitcoin. While Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies appear safe, Bitcoin looks likely to remain a contested issue in European politics.

The company will begin to offer merchants the option of paying users in cryptocurrency. The rollout of cryptocurrency payments begins on Friday, April 22 with Twitter, Inc. (TWTR), before eventually expanding to other merchants.
For now, Stripe will only allow payments to be made through the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC).
Key Takeaways Online payments company Stripe announced that it is expanding into the cryptocurrency space for the first time since discontinuing Bitcoin payments in 2018.
Stripe will allow merchants to pay users with the stablecoin USDC.
Twitter is the first merchant to utilize Stripe's new USDC payments option and will pay some select users in its Ticket Spaces and Super Follows program.
Stripe says that additional cryptocurrency payout options will follow.
Stablecoin USDC Selected First
Twitter will be the first company to utilize Stripe's new cryptocurrency payment method. The social media company will provide certain users with the option to receive earnings from its paid Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces features in USDC.
Stripe's decision to allow merchants to pay users in cryptocurrency is company's the first move into the crypto space in several years. In January 2018, Stripe stopped accepting payments in Bitcoin, saying that the tokens volatility and lack of efficiency made it a poor choice for everyday transactions. As a stablecoin, USDC is pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing it with more price stability than Bitcoin and many other crypto tokens.
More Options Likely to Come
Since giving up Bitcoin functionality, Stripe has more recently explored Web3, a movement aiming to decentralize the internet using blockchain technology. The company created a team in 2021 dedicated to exploring Web3 and cryptocurrency options. Now, Stripe says that it will likely add support for additional payout cryptocurrencies in the future.
Stripe is not the only payments company expanding its platform to include digital tokens. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL), Mastercard Incorporated (MA), and other major payments services companies have all previously announced that they will move into the cryptocurrency space.
How is Stripe using cryptocurrencies? Stripe will now allow merchants—beginning with Twitter—to offer payouts to users in the cryptocurrency USDC.
Why does Stripe use USDC? USDC is a stablecoin that is backed by the U.S. dollar. This means that it has price stability not necessarily found in many popular digital tokens. Stripe cited Bitcoin's volatility as one reason the payments company discontinued payments in cryptocurrency in 2018."

The Problem
In order to mine effectively, specialised computer hardware is required, which uses a large amount of electricity to function properly.
Additionally, mining farms, which are large-scale mining operations, operate in a variety of places throughout the world, taking use of the quickest internet connections and cheapest energy sources.
The construction of cryptocurrencies is also a concern, as the majority of Proof of Work coins use an algorithm that makes hashes more complex to solve with time, raising electricity consumption and accompanying costs.
Concerns being raised across the world
This process requires a lot of energy and has been a cause of concern for environmentalists. Recently, US House Democrats including Jamaal Bowman of California; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; and Jesús G. ""Chuy"" García and Marie Newman of Illinois have called crypto mining an “Environmental Threat.”
The European Union had attracted great attention with its recent talks on a possible ban on proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Environmental pollution caused by huge energy consumption was one of their major arguments to place the ban.
The move towards a greener future
But latest trends show that crypto mining is going green by the day. Ethereum, the decentralised, open-source blockchain with the first ever smart contract functionality, has started moving towards Proof of Stake protocols from Proof of Work protocols and this step is promising because the energy consumption on the blockchain would drastically drop.
Furthermore, as per research released in January by the Bitcoin Mining Council, the worldwide Bitcoin mining sector is being powered by an estimated 58.5 per cent renewable energy by the fourth quarter of 2021.
Q4 #Bitcoin Mining Council Survey Confirms Improvements in Sustainable Power Mix and Technological Efficiency. Estimated sustainable energy mix was 58.5%. Join us at 5pm ET today for a full briefing.https://t.co/t1gTZV9GtT — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) January 18, 2022
Norway leads the way
Moreover, a recent report by the Norwegian government highlights how it is setting an example when it comes to green Bitcoin mining.
Because Norway has access to hydropower and other renewable energy sources, Bitcoin miners in the country are more environmentally friendly than practically everywhere else on the earth. In fact, renewable energy sources account for 100 per cent of Norway's electricity generation capacity.
Of Norway's annual electricity production of 157 Terrawatt hours (TWh), 88 percent is generated by hydroelectric power, with the remaining 20 percent coming from wind and thermal energy.
China is also considering greener Bitcoin mining as a possible trillion-dollar industry.
Does all this indicate Bitcoin mining is getting greener by the day? We will keep watch."

Following recent back-to-back surges in price, both ETH and BTC were down during Friday’s session. Bitcoin fell by almost 5% today, while ETH was down by a similar figure, with both retreating back towards levels of support.
Bitcoin
After a strong rebound in prices mid-week, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was trading lower on Friday, as BTC fell to its support level.
Following a peak of $42,699.87 during Thursday’s session, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $40,063.83 earlier today.
This was marginally below the long-term floor of $40,100 for bitcoin, and comes as prices failed to break out of yesterday’s resistance at $42,700.
Despite the break coming very close to occurring, this historical resistance point held firm, with bulls giving way to a bearish onslaught.
Price strength has also turned to weakness, with the 14-day RSI failing to break its own resistance of 48.77.
As of writing, this indicator is now trading at a floor of 42.85, and should this level break, then we could be in-store for a red wave this weekend.
Ethereum
The red wave may have already begun in the eyes of ETH bulls, as prices once again fell below support of $3,000.
Despite a recent run, which saw prices rise to as high as $3,187.93 less than 24 hours ago, ETH/USD slipped to a low of $2,962.41 today.
The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency moved below its long-term floor of $3,000 as a result, as prices once again consolidated.
Just yesterday, markets were preparing for an extended bullish run, with traders targeting $3,300, with the more optimistic eyeing a $3,500 ceiling.
However, as with bitcoin, ETH failed to move past resistance, as bears re-entered the market in huge numbers at the $3,150 ceiling.
As a result of today’s drop, the 14-day RSI is also tracking at support, which means we could still see either an extension of today’s fall, or a rebound in price to begin the weekend tomorrow.
Could we see ETH and BTC continue to consolidate for the remainder of April? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

Bitcoin fell below $40,000 to start the weekend, as crypto markets continued to be submerged by the latest red wave. ETH was also lower on Saturday, and remained in the red for a second consecutive session.
Bitcoin
BTC dropped below the $40,000 level to start the weekend, following a three-day losing streak which has pushed price close to multi-week lows.
Following a peak of $40,524.76 on Friday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency fell to a low of $39,315.42 earlier today.
This move is less than 48 hours removed from BTC/USD trading above resistance of $42,500. However, following a false breakout prices have moved back towards support.
The support point on this occasion is the $39,500 floor, where bitcoin started trading this week, before its initial midweek rally.
Ultimately, today’s return to support has been a perfect encapsulation of the current volatility within crypto markets this week, and April in general, where we have mainly seen consolidation.
In addition to this, the 14-day RSI is now tracking at 40.5 which is an area where bullish momentum typically picks up — as such, the possibility of a rebound remains high.
Ethereum
ETH was lower for a fourth consecutive session, as prices once again traded below the $3,000 support level.
As of writing, today’s low sees ETH/USD fall to a bottom of $2,926.74, which comes after a high of $3,007.41 yesterday.
Since this low, which broke past support of $2,950, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency moved marginally higher, as bulls re-entered.
Typically, we have seen strong bullish pressure at this floor, and so far today this has been the case, with ETH now trading at $2,963.86.
Looking at the chart, the RSI indicator is also hovering close to its own support of 43.50, however if this strength turns to weakness, there could be an even bigger drop in ethereum’s price.
We will now likely see high levels of uncertainty this weekend, as both bulls and bears continue to jockey for positions.

Eng Taing is in the business of making money. He runs his own private equity firm with $250 million in assets under management (according to his website), invests in real estate, has worked in data science and analytics at Apple — and he got into bitcoin back in 2013, well before it was popular to make even a passive bet on the crypto asset class. Now, Taing runs 261 personal mining machines generating the world's most popular digital token. ""I just like making money,"" Taing told CNBC. ""I invest in a lot of things. I have a lot of apartment buildings, I have senior living homes. I have GPU mines,"" continued Taing. ""I just like to look at where I can get some good arbitrage advantage, and I thought bitcoin mining presented that both from just, 'Hey, I could get more bitcoin by having miners than buying bitcoin, especially at the scale that I can get into it — but also, that I am a big believer in bitcoin's future.'"" Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work mining model, meaning that miners around the world run high-powered computers to simultaneously create new bitcoin and to validate transactions. The process requires expensive equipment, some technical know-how, and a lot of electricity. Taing decided to outsource most of that work by enlisting the help of Compass Mining, a service that hosts, supplies, and operates mining rigs for retail miners who don't want to deal with the logistics of physically handling mining equipment themselves. So far, the experiment is working out pretty well, according to Taing. Of his 261 mining rigs, which include Canaan AvalonMiners, Bitmain Antminer S19 Pros, and Whatsminer M30Ss, 200 are hosted through Compass in Nebraska and Canada. They generate about 2.8 bitcoin a month, or about $111,000, according to digital receipts he provided CNBC. Taing also earns income buying and selling mining hardware to retail customers on Compass' marketplace. They typically buy one or two at a time and are not as price sensitive. CNBC spoke to multiple Compass customers to better understand the appetite for small-scale mining as they increasingly compete with major industry players with massive operations. But Compass CEO Whit Gibbs says that's exactly the point: To capture market share for retail miners and put the network into the hands of the people. ""It will effectively give small miners a substantial share of bitcoin's network hashrate, which has ultimately, always been our goal,"" said Gibbs. ""We want to get 5% of the network being controlled by retail miners, and then move that up to 10% to 15% in the coming years."" Gibbs says he's noticed a lot of people who would normally invest in real estate are instead bringing those dollars to mining, because they're able to see a faster return on mining than they would if they were buying a rental property, especially as private equity steps in to buy houses and drive up prices.

From mining 'plebs' to billionaires
Compass clients range from self-proclaimed ""plebs,"" who stack the smallest denomination of bitcoin known as satoshis, or ""sats,"" to billionaire bitcoiner Jack Dorsey. One of those plebs is Jon McClellan, a Texas based lobbyist for AT&T. He currently has a single bitcoin miner with Compass in Oklahoma, which he purchased at the end of 2020. For him, the desire to mine is part ideological, part financial. ""I wanted to do my part to secure the the bitcoin network — have my own hashrate, under my own power,"" said McClellan, referring to his share of the collective computing power of miners worldwide. ""I knew that if I buy a miner, I'll be literally buying bitcoin every day, every minute, every second, every hour, regardless of what's going on in my life, budget-wise,"" continued McClellan, who calls the process an ""easy way to dollar cost average into bitcoin."" McClellan says Compass was the only retail mining company that seemed accessible for the average person. Compass Mining allows customers to buy (new or used) mining machines for between $4,500 and $25,800 on their website, then locates them in partner data centers and takes care of the physical logistics and subsequent maintenance. The return on investment for personal mining varies based on a few key factors, including the upfront cost of buying gear, the number of mining machines you're running, the cost of electricity and hosting, plus pool fees, which allow a single miner to combine their hashing power with thousands of other miners all over the world to increase their chances of earning bitcoin. McClellan, who took out a bitcoin-backed loan of $10,000 through Coinbase at an 8% interest rate to buy his single miner, says that his ROI is about two years. He is currently pulling in around $400 a month, though he has to pay $150 for hosting fees, so he nets about $250. But McClellan has plans to scale up his operation this year in Texas, Oklahoma, or Wyoming, since all three states are favorable to the bitcoin mining industry. Taing says he has about 18 months until he achieves ROI with profit margins of around 65% to 70% to cover operating expenses. Unlike other customers, however, Taing has a special rate of 0% for pool fees through Foundry. Gibbs, the Compass CEO, says their customer base is mostly retail, which he defines as miners who buy one to five machines, investing somewhere between $10,000 and $50,000. ""That's really where the majority of our business has been over the last six months,"" said Gibbs, though he notes that Compass is beginning to serve more institutional clients. Nevin Bannister, for example, is using Compass to build out a large-scale bitcoin mining operation in hopes of taking it to the public market. ""They make it really simple,"" said Bannister. ""They are a great turnkey option. They help you buy the machines, they plug them in for you, they maintain all the operations."" So far, Bannister has bought 6,000 rigs, 1,500 of which are operational. Most are housed in Oklahoma, and they have just under a hundred in Canada. While Bannister wouldn't disclose his monthly revenue, he did tell CNBC that each rig should produce about .015 bitcoin a month. At 1,500 rigs, that hypothetically produces 270 bitcoin a year, or $10.7 million. ""I'm a serial entrepreneur. I've had several companies that I've sold, and I just love learning new things,"" continued Bannister, who says on his LinkedIn page that he has founded start-ups that have sold for a combined value of over $800 million. ""This is like getting into the internet in the early days."" Ultimately, Gibbs thinks that institutional buyers like Bannister will be a good thing for the smaller-scale miners, because their investment will help to bring down costs overall and make more space available to retail clients.

Jack Dorsey also leaning in
Jack Dorsey's payments company Block (formerly Square) is also looking to make it easier for the little guy to start mining for bitcoin. In a string of tweets earlier this year, Block's general manager for hardware, Thomas Templeton, laid out the company's plans for next steps. Templeton says the goal is to make bitcoin mining — the process of creating new bitcoins by solving increasingly complex computational problems — more distributed and efficient in every way, ""from buying, to set up, to maintenance, to mining."" Toward that end, the company is solving one major barrier to entry: Mining rigs are hard to find, expensive, and delivery can be unpredictable. Block says it is open to making a new ASIC, which is the specialized gear used to mine for bitcoin.

317,2022-04-23,2022-04-23,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Stefania Palma,www.ft.com,Grayscale makes fresh push for SEC approval to become bitcoin ETF,Crypto asset manager has focused on key legal detail in letter to regulator ahead of July deadline,https://www.ft.com/content/b794ffbe-410a-4293-a45e-82ce019dfdf9,"Grayscale has made a fresh attempt to win approval from the US securities watchdog to turn the world’s largest crypto investment vehicle into a fund that trades on major Wall Street exchanges.
The asset manager has focused on a legal detail in a bid to bolster its application with the Securities and Exchange Commission to convert its $40bn Bitcoin Trust into an exchange traded fund, according to a letter sent to the regulator.
Grayscale’s manoeuvre comes as the SEC is deliberating over whether to give the go-ahead for US exchange traded funds to hold bitcoin, rather than derivatives linked to the cryptocurrency, for the first time. The regulator has said it will make a decision regarding Grayscale’s application in early July at the latest.
Several rivals have already been rebuked in their attempts to open similar funds and Grayscale’s gambit represents one of the crypto industry’s last hopes of launching such a product in the near future. Only three other similar crypto ETFs are in the queue for approval.
The SEC has pushed back against so-called spot crypto ETFs due to concerns that the coins trade on unregulated platforms where surveillance is difficult and manipulation a consistent problem. It has approved ETFs holding crypto futures, but those products trade on platforms that are overseen by US financial regulators.
Grayscale is betting that the SEC’s acceptance earlier this month of the Teucrium futures crypto vehicle under rules that would govern spot bitcoin ETFs could be used to bolster its case to the regulator.
In a letter submitted to the SEC this week, Grayscale said: “We believe the Teucrium order confirms the fundamental point . . . [that] when it comes to approving [exchange traded products], there is no basis for treating spot bitcoin products differently from bitcoin futures products.”
Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, added that following the Teucrium approval, the SEC “is effectively losing the ability to rely on the distinction” between rules governing futures ETFs and spot ETFs as a reason to reject funds linked to physical bitcoin.
The SEC declined to comment.
Some compliance professionals remain sceptical over whether Grayscale’s new legal gambit will pay off.
SEC chief Gary Gensler has argued that “largely unregulated” bitcoin markets raise fraud and manipulation concerns. He has also called on crypto platforms to register with the agency and argued that most tokens are securities and fall under the SEC’s purview.
Amy Lynch, founder and president of FrontLine Compliance, a regulatory consultancy, said that the SEC’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs will remain difficult until matters including the funds’ pricing, valuation, custody and liquidity are standardised and more transparent.
“Gensler would have to change his position at this point,” Lynch added. “I don’t see him doing that unless there’s some lightbulb moment with these filings that answers all the questions. And I think that’s a low probability.”
But crypto players argue the evolution of the bitcoin market in recent years should assuage these concerns.
“The markets themselves have become a lot more robust since the first wave of ETFs were denied back in 2017,” said Salm, adding that crypto exchanges have boosted protections via heightened trade surveillance and use of technology similar to that in US national securities exchanges.
Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management — which has filed one of the outstanding applications for a fund holding bitcoin — said that while the maturation of the regulated CME spot bitcoin market was “the most important factor”, the broader crypto ecosystem had improved thanks to the launch of regulated ETFs abroad and the entry of more institutional players.
Timothy Spangler, partner at Dechert, said it was unclear what other information the SEC would require to approve spot bitcoin ETFs when other regulators such as in Australia and Canada had approved these products.
These countries “seem to be able to get comfortable” with the notion that “bitcoin is a mature enough asset to be included in a publicly traded vehicle”, he said.
“I fear that the opposition to including broader amounts of crypto in retail financial products is more philosophical than has to do with specifics,” Spangler added. “I don’t think this is a game of inches.”"

There are a few things you’ll need to prepare before you can get started on using a Bitcoin ATM:
A crypto wallet
The first thing you'll need before using a Bitcoin ATM is a crypto wallet. More specifically, you'll need a Bitcoin wallet. A crypto wallet is an app or a piece of software that allows you to store your crypto.
In this case, you'll need a wallet that specifically supports Bitcoin (BTC) — one that allows you to send and receive Bitcoin. It shouldn't be a challenge to find a good one as Bitcoin is virtually the most popular cryptocurrency out there. There are many different types of wallets, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages.
Related: Bitcoin wallets: A beginner's guide to storing BTC
A Bitcoin ATM near you
Once you have a wallet, you will need to find a Bitcoin ATM. Bitcoin ATMs are usually located in high-traffic areas, such as shopping malls or airports. They look like traditional ATMs, but they allow you to deposit or withdraw cash in exchange for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin ATMs are not as common as typical ATMs yet, so you might not find one easily, especially if you live in a big city. You'll have to use a live map like Bitcoin ATM Map or Coin ATM Radar to find the Bitcoin ATM location nearest to you. Aside from location, these maps also allow you to filter your search according to operator fees, type of machine and supported cryptocurrencies.
When you find a Bitcoin ATM near you, note down the address or pinpoint the location on your GPS to find it easily when you're ready to use it.
How to buy BTC at a Bitcoin ATM
Once you find a Bitcoin ATM, here's what you need to do:
Step 1: Set up an account with the ATM operator
Most Bitcoin ATMs will require you to create an account with the ATM operator before you can use the machine. This is usually done by scanning your ID or driver's license. The account creation process is usually pretty straightforward.
Step 2: Enter the necessary wallet information
You will be asked to input your wallet information at the ATM, either via a QR code or an alphanumeric key. Scan your Bitcoin wallet QR using your mobile phone. If you do not have a Bitcoin wallet, you can also opt to print a paper wallet at the kiosk, which you can later use to import your Bitcoin into a wallet.
Step 3: Insert cash
Once you have input your wallet information, you can insert the cash you want to convert into Bitcoin. The amount of money you insert and the sum of Bitcoin you'll receive in return will be visible on the screen.
Your Bitcoin wallet's address and the amount to be sent will also appear.
Step 4: Confirm the purchase
The ATM will then ask you to confirm the transaction. Confirm the details of your purchase and hit the send button. Once confirmed, the machine will dispense the corresponding amount of Bitcoin into your wallet. And that's it! You've successfully purchased Bitcoin from a Bitcoin ATM.
Remember, not all Bitcoin ATMs are the same, and the steps required to use them may vary slightly.
How to sell BTC at a Bitcoin ATM
When it comes to selling your Bitcoin, the process is pretty much the same as buying. The only difference is that you will need to select the option to sell —not buy — Bitcoin when you're at the ATM. You'll also have to ensure that the machine you're using supports the sale of Bitcoin.
Follow the steps below to sell your Bitcoin at a Bitcoin ATM:
Step 1: Find a 2-way Bitcoin ATM near you
As with buying Bitcoin, you'll need to find a Bitcoin ATM near you. Most Bitcoin ATMs support the purchase of cryptocurrency, so you'll have to find one that specifically supports crypto selling. Bitcoin ATMs that can process both buying and selling of crypto are called 2-way Bitcoin ATMs or bi-directional Bitcoin ATMs.
Step 2: Set up an account with the ATM operator
You will most likely have to create an account with the ATM operator before you can use the machine. Again, this is usually done by scanning your ID or driver's license.
Related: Bitcoin for cash: Do crypto ATMs make buying BTC easier for the mainstream?
Step 3: Prepare your wallet address to convert your Bitcoin to cash
At the ATM, you will be asked to input your wallet information. You can do this via a QR code or an alphanumeric key. If you're selling Bitcoin, you will need to provide the receiving address, so the ATM knows where to send the cash.
Step 4: Log in to your account on the Bitcoin ATM
After you input your wallet information, you will be asked to log in to your account on the Bitcoin ATM. The login process is usually pretty simple.
Step 5: Select the option to sell Bitcoin
Once you're logged in, select the option to sell Bitcoin. You will then be asked to enter the amount of Bitcoin you want to sell. The machines typically have a minimum and maximum amount that you can sell per transaction.
Step 6: Select the “withdraw cash” option and collect cash
After you enter the amount of Bitcoin you want to sell, select the option to withdraw cash. The ATM will then dispense the corresponding amount of cash, and that's it! You've now successfully sold Bitcoin at a Bitcoin ATM. Again, keep in mind that not all Bitcoin ATMs are the same, and the steps required to use them may vary slightly.
How much does a Bitcoin ATM charge?
Most Bitcoin ATMs charge a percentage of the transaction as a service fee, with a minimum amount charged per transaction. For example, Coinsource, a popular Bitcoin ATM operator in the United States, charges between 6% and 20% per transaction, with an average charge of around 11% nationwide.
There are also minimum and maximum limits per transaction. For instance, most Bitcoin ATMs have a minimum of $20 per transaction. Upper limits can range from $3000 to $9000 per day, depending on the ATM provider.
The fees charged by these ATMs comply with the regulations of the state under which they operate. So, depending on the state you're in, the fees may vary. Generally, though, Bitcoin ATM operators need to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act's Anti-Money Laundering provisions.
Some Bitcoin ATMs also offer the option to buy or sell Bitcoin without any service fees. However, these machines are usually hard to find. Note that even if an ATM doesn't charge any service fees, the price of Bitcoin on these machines tends to be higher than the going rate on exchanges.
This is because the ATM operator needs to make a profit as well. Therefore, it's usually not worth it to buy or sell Bitcoin on a fee-free ATM."

The CEO of the Nasdaq-listed company Microstrategy has dispelled the rumor that his company has been quietly selling bitcoin. He explained that as a company regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), changes in bitcoin holdings must be disclosed to shareholders via SEC filings.
Microstrategy’s CEO Points Out Any Bitcoin Sales Must Be Publicly Disclosed to SEC and Shareholders
This week, a rumor has been circulating on social media that the Nasdaq-listed pro-bitcoin software company Microstrategy has been quietly selling its BTC.
Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted Friday dispelling the rumor. He explained that as a regulated company under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy is required to disclose any material changes in corporate strategy to shareholders via SEC filings.
In addition, the executive emphasized that SEC filings are public records that are “available to all.” He further noted that material changes include acquiring and holding bitcoin as well as making changes to crypto holdings.
Bitcoin.com News published an article this week explaining why the rumor is untrue and the BTC address in question is not owned by Microstrategy. The address is in fact likely owned by a crypto exchange platform.
While some people appreciate Saylor’s clarification, some are still skeptical, choosing to believe that the rumor of Microstrategy selling bitcoin is true.
Saylor has been an avid proponent of BTC. He has repeatedly said that he will not sell his coins anytime soon, noting that he will hold them for a hundred years.
In February, the Microstrategy boss said: “I see evidence of a lot more institutional adoption, greater adoption amongst macro and other hedge funds.” In December last year, he predicted that the price of bitcoin could reach $6 million.
Earlier this month, his company spent $200 million more on acquiring bitcoin, raising its total holdings to 129,218 BTC. Microstrategy obtained a bitcoin-backed loan to purchase the additional coins.
What do you think about the rumor that Microstrategy has been selling bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Kin Cheung/AP Kin Cheung/AP
NEW YORK — More workers may soon be able to stake some of their 401(k) retirement savings to bitcoin, as cryptocurrencies crack even deeper into the mainstream.
Retirement giant Fidelity said Tuesday that it's launched a way for workers to put some of their 401(k) savings and contributions directly in bitcoin, potentially up to 20%, all from the account's main menu of investment options. Fidelity said it's the first in the industry to allow such investments without having to go through a separate brokerage window, and it's already signed up one employer that will add the offering to its plan later this year.
Fidelity's offering may be one of just a few for a while, given the substantial concerns about the riskiness of cryptocurrencies. The U.S. government last month warned the retirement industry to exercise ""extreme care"" when doing something like this, highlighting how inexperienced investors may not appreciate just how volatile cryptocurrencies can be, among other concerns.
Bitcoin had five days in the last year where it plunged by at least 10%. The stocks in the S&P 500, meanwhile, had only two such drops in the last 50 years. Beyond its volatility, there's still fundamental disagreement about how much a bitcoin is worth, or even if it's worth anything at all.
Proponents say cryptocurrencies can boost returns in a well diversified portfolio, without adding too much risk. That's because cryptocurrencies haven't always moved in the same direction as stocks and other investments, though they often have in recent months amid worries about rising interest rates.
Some investors may believe in all those pros of bitcoin, but still prefer not having to open a new account to buy bitcoin, learn the intricacies of how to store them or deal with taxes on gains made in the years running up to retirement. Or they may come around to that belief soon, and Fidelity wanted to be ready for them, said Dave Gray, Fidelity Investments' head of workplace retirement offerings and platforms.
""We have been developing this, anticipating some of the workforce trends that we see coming,"" Gray said. ""Our clients expect us to be ahead and developing innovative solutions.""
A big part of the thrill of crypto for some traders is just how volatile it can be. Not only did bitcoin quadruple over 2020, but traders can buy and sell it 24 hours per day. A regular day for stocks on Wall Street, meanwhile, lasts just six and a half hours.
But the new Fidelity account won't offer that. It will update its price once per day, similar to traditional mutual funds. The account will also come with fees, which can range from 0.75% to 0.90% of assets. That means between $7.50 and $9 of each $1,000 invested in the bitcoin account would go toward paying expenses every year. That's less than some specialty investments but more than vanilla stock index funds, which can be virtually free.
Other firms also want to offer cryptocurrencies in retirement accounts
Others in the industry are also working to offer similar products. At ForUsAll, a 401(k) provider, the company announced a product in June 2021 to allow workers to put some of their 401(k) in cryptocurrencies by sending it to a self-directed window.
CEO Jeff Schulte said the company spoke with the U.S. Labor Department throughout 2021 about marrying crypto and 401(k) accounts. Even after Labor's stern warning last month, Schulte said he still expects the product to launch this quarter. ForUsAll plans to require savers to take an interactive quiz about the risks of cryptocurrencies before buying them, among other moves to educate investors.
""Protecting investors is paramount,"" he said. ""We believe our solution meets all the fiduciary standards under ERISA,"" the federal law that oversees retirement plans.
Fidelity also places what Gray calls ""digital speed bumps"" in front of investors, forcing them to slow down and study the risks and rewards of crypto.
It may take a while for most employers to start offering something like this. The Plan Sponsor Council of America recently asked its members if the Labor Department's warning changed their minds at all in terms of considering crypto.
The majority — 57% — said that they would never consider crypto as a viable investment option regardless. Another third said the warning ""simply affirms the concern we already had."""
322,2022-04-26,2022-04-26,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Tara Siegel Bernard,www.nytimes.com,Fidelity’s New 401(k) Offering Will Invest in Bitcoin,The employer that oversees the retirement savings plan would have to decide to include the digital assets account.,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/business/crypto-401k-fidelity.html,"Fidelity, the nation’s largest provider of 401(k) plans, said on Tuesday that it would enable its participants to put a slice of their retirement money into Bitcoin — if their employers are willing to allow it.
The announcement could put millions of people closer to direct investment in Bitcoin this summer without having to set up an account on a cryptocurrency exchange. But regulators have already said they’re skeptical of the idea: Last month, the Department of Labor, which oversees workplace retirement plans, said it would cast a critical eye on plans that added digital assets to their investment menus.
Fidelity — which held $2.4 trillion in 401(k) assets in 2020, or more than a third of the market, according to the research firm Cerulli Associates — said it was introducing a digital assets account to hold Bitcoin. The account fee will be between 0.75 percent and 0.90 percent of assets, depending on several factors including the employer and the amount invested. An additional trading fee, not yet disclosed, will be “competitively priced,” the firm said."

Fidelity Investments announced Tuesday it will begin allowing investors to put cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in 401(k) retirement accounts, making it the first provider to do so. The offering will be available midyear for the 23,000 companies that use Fidelity for their retirement accounts. (Of course, your employer, as the plan sponsor, has to agree to it.)
Some investors may be wondering if cryptocurrencies have a place in their retirement savings. Many financial advisors say it can be part of a well-balanced investment portfolio, and have noted that clients have already been adding it to their investments outside of employer-sponsored retirement savings.

""I think most retail investors are looking for exposure to something that just gives them the opportunity to participate in what they hope will be the appreciation of bitcoin over the long-term,"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. ""And if this account accomplishes that, I'm elated to see that, I think it's wonderful.""
What to consider before investing
Of course, investors shouldn't rush to add bitcoin or other crypto assets to their 401(k) plans just because they can.
Instead, make sure that if you are going to add it to your retirement account that it fits into your long-term financial goals.
""If your time horizon is 10 years, I think now is a fine time to buy it,"" said Ivory Johnson, a CFP and founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington, D.C. Otherwise, he recommends that investors take a more holistic approach to the asset class instead of trying to time a volatile market.
Investors should have a clear reason for buying crypto instead of being pulled in only because the price dropped, he said. Reasons include seeing the asset as a store of value, viewing it as uncorrelated or wanting to own it because of the increasing rate of adoption."

El Salvador is the only other country that officially uses bitcoin as legal tender in the world. Uptake of the currency since its introduction in the country in September 2021 has been modest.
The CAR parliament unanimously passed a law in favor of the adoption of bitcoin, driven by the need to solve currency and exchange rate challenges.
The BBC quoted Yann Daworo, an economist in the CAR capital Bangui saying, “Businessmen will no longer have to walk around with suitcases of CFA francs that will have to be converted into dollars or any other currency to make purchases abroad.”
A recent report by Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, found that in the height of the pandemic from—mid 2020 to mid 2021—Africans received $105.6 billion in payments, a 1200% increase from the year before.
The CAR is the second country after El Salvador to embrace bitcoin as legal tender
CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera’s office said Wednesday that “adoption of bitcoin as an official currency represents a decisive step towards opening up new opportunities” for the African country.
Plagued by a security situation that the IMF describes as fragile, CAR’s adoption of the most popular cryptocurrency is likely a result of wanting to try something different to try and address long-standing fiscal challenges.
CAR is among about six central African nations—Cameroon, Chad, Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea—that use the Central African CFA franc unit of exchange, “a regional currency backed by France,” according to legal practice, Baker Mckenzie.
The adoption of bitcoin as legal tender by CAR has however not been without its critics though, with some even pointing out that bitcoin works into the hands of Russian warlords in the country.
“CAR remains a failed state, with most of its territory controlled by various rebel groups, although the government will retain key cities, including the capital, Bangui, with support from Russian mercenaries,” says the Economist Intelligence Unit.
One such critic, Didier J Mary, a cryptocurrency skeptic but fintech and digital transformation consultant, told Quartz that bitcoin “will not work” in CAR as it is not a currency, but will instead fuel money laundering in the crisis ravaged African nation.
“It can’t work, won’t work, but it surely pleases the Russian overlords over there, to show that USD domination is dead. So it will fail and probably help the country dig its grave deeper.”
Cryptocurrencies and CBDCs in Africa
Most central banks in Africa prevent banks from processing transactions involving cryptocurrencies. However, this has only pushed cryptocurrency transactions under-ground, with peer-to-peer trading platforms such as LocalBitcoins pushing volumes in Kenya as well as in Zimbabwe among others.
While South Africa is the other regional country that taxes and regulates cryptocurrencies, it falls short of CAR’s bold decision to embrace bitcoin as legal tender.
Other African countries have been more inclined to Central Bank Digital Currencies, which however, according to the Kenyan Central Bank are being held back from full adoption by limited smartphone penetration. Nigeria was the first African country to adopt a CBDC when the eNaira went live last year while Ghana is also forging ahead with plans for the eCedi."

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the global cryptocurrency market cap was standing at $1.81 trillion. This was slightly up by 0.14 per cent over the last 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin price today neared the $40,000 mark again, after crashing down below $39,000 for the first time this month in a recent downfall.
Bitcoin price today was standing at $39,598.09 at the time of writing this article, data from CoinMarketCap showed. This was up by 0.46 per cent over the last 24 hours, but down by 2.74 per cent in the last seven days
“Social interest, particularly in buying the dip, has been increasing during BTC’s recent pullback. According to on-chain data by Santiment, social volume for BTC shot up significantly over the past few days. Though BTC breached the $40,000 level today, it quickly declined below the same level,” said Darshan Bathija, CEO and co founder of Vauld.
“What this indicates is that Bitcoin’s price recovery will not be a walk in the park. The IOMAP model by IntoTheBlock highlights a massive barrier running from $39,099 to $40,245. Investors who bought BTC in this zone would be seeking to liquidate, adding to the selling pressure,” he added
“We also need to keep in mind that almost $2B worth of options will expire today; it’s highly likely that market participants will try to push BTC below $39,000.” further said Bathija to News18.com.
Ether price today was also slightly up by 0.75 per cent. The value of one Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, was standing at $2,925.63 while writing this article. Bitcoin prices have been down by 3.11 per cent in the last seven days.
“Ethereum gained back some lost ground in the last couple of days to edge above $2,900 and gained close to 4% in that period. Ethereum against Bitcoin dropped marginally with the BTC’s dominance index staying edging above 42% for the first time since 25 days. We could expect Ethereum to weaken against BTC in the coming days as Bitcoin’s is expected to rise at a steady rate. The daily trend for ETH against BTC continues its movement within a megaphone pattern. The next resistance is expected at 0.078 and next support is expected at 0.0653,” said the WazirX trade desk.
Dogecoin remained in the 10th position among top cryptocurrencies for four consecutive days, after beating Avalanche, as investors rushed in since Tuesday to invest in this memecoin. This was a direct result of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has backed Dogecoin in the past, buying Twitter.

Trader eyes $40,600 as “crucial” breaker
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hugging support near $39,300 after failing to hold $40,000.
The pair had managed some modest upside despite a “parabolic rally” in U.S. dollar strength throughout the week.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) finally began cooling on April 2 after reaching its highest levels since 2002.
Despite its inverse correlation, BTC/USD had yet to show any signs of direct benefit from the changing mood at the time of writing.
Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe was, nonetheless, confident that bullish momentum would return to Bitcoin in the short term.
“Bitcoin is getting into a narrow playing field and is ready for a big impulse move,” he told Twitter followers on the same day.
“I’m betting on the upside, as the DXY is showing some weakness too. Crucial level to break: $40.3-40.6K first.”
Van de Poppe had previously highlighted current spot price levels as crucial to hold in order to open up the path toward $42,000 and above.

Further tailwinds for BTC came in the form of Asian market trading, meanwhile, with the Shanghai Composite Index up 2.4% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng managing 10% on the day in a broad comeback from earlier COVID-19-induced sell-offs.

European indexes were flatter, with Germany’s DAX up 1.2% and the FTSE 100 up 0.35% in London.
Research warns over hodler “capitulation”
Examining who among Bitcoin holders is selling in current conditions, popular analyst Root identified changing tendencies among long-term holders (LTHs) — those with coins unmoved for 155 days or longer.

Those who bought in between $18,000 and the all-time highs of $69,000 — a significant chunk of the LTH base — are being forced to exit due to external forces, he warned.
“They are de-risking/capitulating due to macro conditions,” part of a Twitter thread read, Root adding that it is “bullish how price has been holding up really well.”
As Cointelegraph recently reported, the percentage of the BTC supply dormant for a year or more has nonetheless made new all-time highs this month, according to data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.

Anti-climate change activists protested outside the meeting, held in Bern, demanding the SNB ended its investment in companies they say are contributing to global warming via carbon emissions.
""The Swiss National Bank invests billions in the fossil fuel industry every year,"" said Nora Scheel from the group Campax. ""In doing so, it generates almost as many CO2 emissions as the whole of Switzerland does domestically.""
The SNB, which has 937 billion in foreign currency investments, has reduced its investment in energy and fossil fuel companies from 10% of its holdings to around 3% to 4%, Chairman Jordan said.
""It makes no sense for us to sell all our shares, they would just be bought by someone else. The important thing is that the economy can transform itself ..to produce less CO2 emissions,"" Jordan told the AGM.
""That should be done in a systematic and orderly manner. We are already seeing the problem in energy supply at present, with rising energy prices causing problems especially for people with low incomes.""
The SNB has already ruled out investing in companies mainly involved in coal mining, he added, but could not exclude oil and gas investments overnight.

330,2022-05-02,2022-05-20,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Walter Frick,qz.com,What Warren Buffett said about bitcoin,The Oracle of Omaha was asked about bitcoin at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting and claimed he wouldn't buy the cryptocurrency at any price.,https://qz.com/2161126/what-warren-buffett-said-about-bitcoin/,"Value investor Warren Buffett took his antipathy toward crypto to new heights over the weekend. The Oracle of Omaha was asked about bitcoin at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting over the weekend and claimed he wouldn’t buy it at any price.
“If you told me you owned all the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn’t take it because what would I do with it?” Buffett said. “I’d have to sell it back to you, one way or the other. It isn’t going to produce anything… That explains the difference between productive assets and something that depends on the next guy paying you more than the last guy paid for it.”
Why Warren Buffett doesn’t like bitcoin
The heart of Buffett’s crypto critique goes back to first principles. “Assets, to have value, they have to deliver something to somebody,” he told the audience. Compare that to a slightly different perspective: For an asset to have value, someone must be willing to pay for it.
Those concepts are not the same, even though financial markets often treat them as if they are.
As Mariana Mazzucato, an economist at University College London, explains in her book The Value of Everything, early economists distinguished between actual “value creation,” where new, socially useful resources were created, and “value extraction,” where money changed hands but nothing was produced. (Adam Smith had a list of which industries he thought did and didn’t create value.) Over time, economics became more “subjective”—more willing to defer to consumers about what value meant to them, and so willing to treat market demand as a measure of value.
Buffett’s view makes perfect sense seen through this lens: Unlike an apartment or a farm, two examples he used for contrast, bitcoin has no productive value so it has no worth.
Warren Buffett’s blind spot
Though Buffett is the world’s most famous value investor, that doesn’t mean he invests only in virtuous, socially beneficial companies—the kind of value Mazzucato talks about. Value investing started out closer to what today we’d call distressed assets. The field got its start in the 1920s when investor Benjamin Graham realized some companies were valued less than the sum of their parts. You could buy them, dismantle them, sell everything off, and make a profit.
Buffett’s flavor of value investing involves buying stable, well-managed companies, but even his version of value investing has a complicated relationship with social value. Buffett says he likes to invest in companies with “moats,” meaning some barrier to competition. That’s fine, up to a point and depending on where the moat comes from. But as the world’s richest troll Elon Musk has argued, “Saying you like ‘moats’ is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies.”
To Musk, the only good kind of strategic advantage for a company is technological innovation—a form of productive, tangible value creation that Buffett has consistently missed out on. (He has admitted he didn’t grasp the potential of Google and Amazon and didn’t come around to internet companies until 2011.)
And ultimately, that’s the case for crypto—that it’s not just financial speculation but instead a fundamental technological breakthrough that will eventually enable new, productive use cases that even an investor as accomplished as Buffett just can’t imagine."
331,2022-05-02,2022-05-02,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,gizmodo.com,$25 is Overpriced For All Bitcoin in the World,"""Assets, to have value, they have to deliver something to somebody.""",https://gizmodo.com/warren-buffett-all-bitcoin-world-25-dollars-assets-valu-1848866967,"Warren Buffett has always been a bitcoin skeptic. But the billionaire investor had his harshest words yet for the cryptocurrency over the weekend. Buffett made it clear that his opposition to crypto has nothing to do with whether people can make money trading bitcoin. Buffett’s opposition is purely on principle because bitcoin has no intrinsic value.
“Whether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don’t know. But the one thing I’m pretty sure of is that it doesn’t multiply, it doesn’t produce anything,” Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on Saturday.
“It’s got a magic to it and people have attached magics to lots of things,” Buffett continued.

Buffett, who’s worth $124 billion, explained that if the people who attended his meeting somehow owned all the farmland in the U.S. and he was offered a 1% stake on that farmland for $25 billion, he’d write out a check immediately because it’s a great deal on something that’s productive. Buffett said he’d make a similar deal for 1% of all the apartment rentals in the U.S., if that was somehow on offer.
“If you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn’t take it because what would I do with it? I’d have to sell it back to you one way or another. Maybe it’d be the same people, but it isn’t going to do anything,” Buffett said.
“The apartments are going to produce rental and the farms are going to produce food. And if I’ve got all the bitcoin...” Buffett said trailing off before referring to Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, who “may or may not have existed.”
“[Satoshi] could create a mystery about it. But everyone knows what I’m like,” Buffett said, suggesting that bitcoin only became the world’s most popular cryptocurrency because there’s a big mystery surrounding its origins.
“Certain things have value that don’t produce something tangible. I mean, you can say a great painting probably will have some value 500 years from now,” Buffett said.

“But assets, to have value, they have to deliver something to somebody and there’s only one currency. You can come up with all kinds of things. We can put up Berkshire coins, or Berkshire money,” Buffett said, referring to a hypothetical crypto coin.
“But in the end this is money,” Buffett said, holding up a $20 bill. “But this is the only thing that’s money. Anybody who thinks the United States is going to change the way they let Berkshire money replace theirs is out of their mind.”"

In his latest YouTube update on May 2, Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe argued that USD’s current surge would not last long.
Dollar strength reversal ""close""
Bitcoin is still under pressure as stocks and crypto alike face the reality of a major policy flip from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Due to be announced this week, the Fed is tipped to end the “free money” era since the March 2020 COVID crash once and for all — and risk assets should be first to suffer.
The COVID crash saw the previous peak in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which then declined as Bitcoin led crypto markets to new highs.
That inverse correlation since turned around once more, and now, with DXY at twenty-year highs, crypto is on the receiving end of pain.
Van de Poppe notes, however, that compared to previous DXY bull runs, Bitcoin has lost considerably less in USD terms. 2014, for example, saw BTC/USD shed over 80%, while the drawdown from its all-time highs in November 2022 has so far only totaled a maximum of 55%.

“Right now, we’re seeing this implied strength, and I think that the dollar is getting into a period where we’re getting done of that move,” he commented, adding that a reversal was “close.”
Nonetheless, Van de Poppe said, the “Bitcoin bear market might continue,” and if so, targets for the downside now extend beyond $30,000 to $25,000.
""Massive speculative excesses""
On the long-term view, popular analysts continued to favor Bitcoin’s enduring strength following a period of upcoming pain.
Related: Fed ‘will determine the fate of the market’ — 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week
Speaking to Wall of All Streets Podcast host Scott Melker on May 2, Mike McGlone, chief commodities strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that a reset of crypto and traditional markets alike was “already happening.”
“This is an ebbing tide of massive speculative excesses in all markets; cryptos were just a great leading indicator and now we’re taking the tide out and it’s a question of how far,” he explained.
“This week, the Fed’s going to raise 50 basis points for the first time in years; I could go back and check but I haven’t seen that in a long time.”
As before, McGlone nonetheless predicted that Bitcoin would ultimately benefit from the upcoming upheaval.
“I think that’s going to be part of the trigger that’s going to flush out the rest of the excesses in the market, most notably equities, and then Bitcoin will come out ahead — and it’s already happening,” he added.

But he wouldn't do the same for bitcoin and its over-$700 billion market cap .
Asked Saturday at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting if he had changed his famously negative views on bitcoin or crypto, the 91-year-old investor didn't mince his words.
It doesn't look like legendary investor Warren Buffett will be adding bitcoin to his portfolio any time soon.
""If you ... owned all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it,"" Buffett said. ""Because what would I do with it? I'll have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything.""
He described his views on farmland and rental properties versus bitcoin as ""the difference between productive assets and something that depends on the next guy paying you more than the last guy got.""
""The apartments are going to produce rent and the farms are going to produce food,"" he said. ""If I've got all the bitcoin, I'm back wherever [anonymous bitcoin founder Satoshi] was.""
He attributed the allure of bitcoin to a type of ""magic"" that draws investors.
""Whether it goes up or down in the next year or five years or 10 years, I don't know. But one thing I'm sure of is that it doesn't multiply, it doesn't produce anything,"" he said. ""It's got a magic to it, and people have attached magic to lots of things.""
Buffett has long been against cryptocurrencies. He told CNBC in 2018 that ""they will come to a bad ending"" and said that Berkshire Hathaway will ""never have a position in them.""
""I get into enough trouble with the things I think I know something about,"" he said at the time. ""Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don't know about?""

336,2022-05-04,2022-05-22,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,The Associated Press,www.nbcnews.com,California moves to embrace cryptocurrency and regulate it,"California, which has an economy larger than all but four countries and where much of the world’s technological innovation is born, on Wednesday became the",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/california-moves-embrace-cryptocurrency-regulate-rcna27402,"California, which has an economy larger than all but four countries and where much of the world’s technological innovation is born, on Wednesday became the first state to formally begin examining how to broadly adapt to cryptocurrency and related innovations.
Following a path laid out by President Joe Biden in March, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order for state agencies to move in tandem with the federal government to craft regulations for digital currencies. It also calls for officials to explore incorporating broader blockchain computer coding into the government operations.
Evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency technology “is potentially an explosive creator of new companies and new jobs and new opportunities,” said Dee Dee Myers, a senior advisor to Newsom and director of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development.
“So there are a lot of opportunities,” she said. “There’s also a lot of unknowns in the industry and so that’s another reason we want to engage early.”
Newsom’s order says the state — home to Silicon Valley and financial innovators like PayPal and Square — should be out front in figuring out how to adapt to new technologies.
“Too often government lags behind technological advancements, so we’re getting ahead of the curve on this, laying the foundation to allow for consumers and business to thrive,” Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement.
California has about 39 million residents and its economy is more than $3.1 trillion, larger than the United Kingdom and India. Newsom said his order is a step toward making it the nation’s first state “to establish a comprehensive, thoughtful, and harmonized regulatory and business environment for crypto assets.”
Cryptocurrencies, which are built on blockchain database technology, have exploded in popularity in recent years. About 16% of U.S. adults have invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrencies and the percentage is much higher among younger men. Biden’s executive order in part asks the Federal Reserve to consider whether it should create its own digital currency.
Blockchain creates the underlying transparency of a decentralized but publicly viewable ledger. The technology can also be used to record other types of information, such as property records. The records are held on many computers that together form a global network so that no one and no institution can control them.
There is heavy disagreement about the legitimacy of cryptocurrency, even among some of the world’s richest people. Elon Musk is an avid supporter of dogecoin while Warren Buffet recently said he wouldn’t pay $25 for all of the world’s bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. Each bitcoin is currently valued at about $38,000 but fluctuates wildly.
California’s approach will help to legitimize the technology and bring it into the mainstream, said cryptocurrency skeptic Hilary Allen, a financial regulation professor at American University in Washington, D.C. But she doesn’t think it’s the best approach for the state and its residents.
She said private investors are most likely to benefit, while state government should seek simpler technological solutions rather than turning to technology that “is by its very nature complex and inefficient.”
“While this approach will create more of a market for crypto ... it is unlikely to produce the best outcomes for users of public services in California,” Allen said.
California may be first to try to develop a comprehensive approach, but Ohio was the first to attempt to accept virtual currency for government services in 2018, though the program was soon discontinued because few people used it.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, also a Democrat, said in February that his state would begin accepting cryptocurrency for government services later this year.
California lawmakers are among many around the the U.S. who have offered related legislation. But a bill by Democratic Sen. Sydney Kamlager to allow California to accept crypto assets for state services failed in its first committee this year and a similar bill by Republican Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham is stalled.
Similar measures have been introduced in Arizona, Wyoming and other states.
Despite the potential pitfalls of cryptocurrency, Newsom’s order says California should take the lead in figuring out how to adapt to the technological evolution.
His order builds on a July 2020 report by the California Blockchain Working Group, which examined the use of blockchain along with its risks and benefits.
California that same year created a new Department of Financial Protection and Innovation from what had been the Department of Business Oversight, with a goal of evaluating emerging risks and opportunities while protecting consumers.
Newsom’s order calls for the department to develop guidelines for disclosures by companies when they offer financial products and services related to cryptocurrencies. It will also provide guidelines for state-chartered banks and credit unions regarding crypto-related products.
The department will respond to consumer complaints, work with crypto companies to resolve consumer complaints and take enforcement action when needed. It will also publish consumer education materials, including advice on avoiding crypto-related scams and frauds.
Newsom’s order directs a separate agency to solicit proposals for how best to use blockchain to help the state and the public.
“It is critical that we engage early with industry and start learning the pros and cons of innovative technology early,” said Amy Tong, secretary of California’s Government Operations Agency. “We can take the next steps towards getting ahead of the curve and harnessing potential of these tools to make government better.”"
337,2022-05-04,2022-05-04,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Geoff Williams,Nrf Contributor",nrf.com,Cryptocurrency and its role in retail,A guide to the cutting-edge customer payment option.,https://nrf.com/blog/cryptocurrency-and-its-role-in-retail,"Cryptocurrency can feel like another language, but we’ve been here before. If you’re a business owner in the 1990s, you remember being urged to put up a website. It seemed like a potential waste of time: If a customer wanted to find you, they could use a phone book. Apps, artificial intelligence, delivery services — plenty of other developments have come down the pike that might have seemed unnecessary until suddenly it was obvious they were a benefit to a business.
If you hear the word “cryptocurrency” or more specifically, references to Bitcoin or Ether or Litecoin, your eyes might be glazing over. Even if you feel like you understand cryptocurrency, though, you might be reluctant to take it as a payment.
“Right now, I’d say the mood among business owners is uncertain,” says Leon Buck, the National Retail Federation’s vice president of banking and financial services.
There’s good reason for that uncertainty. At the moment, Buck says, “I would say that cryptocurrency doesn’t really meet the standard to be called currency. It’s risky to accept it because it’s such a highly speculative investment. A dollar in Bitcoin might be worth $1.50 tomorrow or fifty cents. It’s a highly speculative notion that doesn’t work for retailers right now.”
Tomorrow, he concedes, might be another story. So, if you’re not up to speed, consider this your cryptocurrency crash course.
What is cryptocurrency?
It’s hard for any casual bystander to wrap their head around the very idea of cryptocurrency. For starters, there are over 10,000 different cryptocurrencies.
There are a lot of confusing rabbit holes to go down — like cryptocurrency mines, which aren’t holes in the ground where miners dig for minerals, but more like warehouses full of rows of computers — but the easiest way to explain it is that cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency.
NRF Nexus 2022 Join us for NRF Nexus and learn more about the latest retail technology being used for payments.
It’s true that cash feels like it’s digital these days, since most of us rarely have dollar bills in our wallet and instead spend money with a credit or debit card. But it’s still commonplace to go to an ATM and take out cash sometimes. Cryptocurrency wasn’t built to be held in one’s hand. It’s literally a digital piece of currency, created by computers and algorithms.
Any time someone buys or sells cryptocurrency, that transaction is recorded on a decentralized ledger called a blockchain. Those transactions are secured using a technology called cryptography, which is how the industry coined the term “cryptocurrency.”
Incidentally, “secured” is the important word in that last sentence. Because of the way blockchain technology works, counterfeiting cryptocurrency is virtually impossible. It’s secure from counterfeiters, and that’s one of its big selling points.
Another positive — depending on your point of view — is that this money isn’t backed by the government or a central bank. It’s created and managed by computer networks.
But the value of many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, is often changing, and that’s a negative for many retailers. You don’t want to be in possession of a lot of cryptocurrency that is worth a lot of money one day and the virtually nothing the next.
What does it mean for a retailer to accept cryptocurrency?
It still isn’t common for retailers to accept cryptocurrency; if you don’t, you aren’t behind the times. If you do accept crypto or are considering doing so, you might end up ahead of the curve. But there’s nothing wrong with remaining in a wait-and-see mode.
“It’s up to each retailer and what they think and believe. We believe in retail choice and whatever best fits the consumers’ needs,” Buck says.
NRF is spending a lot of time talking with federal agency officials about the future of cryptocurrency. A serious concern is what happens when credit card issuers ultimately become involved: Some credit cards are already giving consumers rewards back in the form of cryptocurrency.
“Right now, our position is that cryptocurrency shouldn’t be allowed to become just another mechanism for the credit industry to collect another fee,” Buck says.
Whether it’s a good idea for a retailer to accept crypto is anybody’s guess. It can be argued that it makes sense for retailers to — at some point — accept crypto, since that means ultimately giving customers another way to pay.
“Individuals have more options of payment tools at their disposal, whether cash, credit or crypto, and retailers that offer the ability to accept cryptocurrency payments should gain a competitive advantage,” says James Putra, vice president of product strategy at TradeStation Crypto, a cryptocurrency trading platform headquartered in Florida.
Putra says he has seen that lately with charities that have been accepting crypto payments: TradeStation Crypto has helped several nonprofits set up the ability to take crypto donations.
Economy at a glance Keep up with the latest economic developments in the retail industry at our Economy headquarters.
“These charities have been gaining access to a much younger demographic,” Putra says, adding that older taxpayers are often more sensitive to the tax ramifications of donating and generally donate in December before the new tax year.
“The people who are donating using cryptocurrency are donating smaller amounts,” he says, “but they’re doing it more frequently and throughout the year, rather than just at the end.”
There are other benefits beyond giving customers another way to pay, says Steven Gordon, a professor of operations and information management at Babson College. One of the classes Gordon teaches is called “Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.”
He lists several reasons retailers might want to consider accepting crypto as payment: It provides the ability to accept sales internationally without paying foreign exchange fees; it eliminates fraudulent chargebacks, which are common with credit card payments; it reduces transaction fees.
Accepting crypto as payment might also satisfy the preferences of some customers, allow retailers to appear “modern” and provide experience with the means of payment before it becomes required for competitive reasons.
That said, there’s no need to rush. “I think this will be many years away,” Gordon says.
How would a retailer accept crypto payments?
There are mainly two approaches: get a cryptocurrency wallet or use a third-party processor to facilitate crypto sales, says Eric Chason, a professor of law at William & Mary Law School who has done extensive research on cryptocurrencies.
“Retailers that want to handle crypto directly would need to feel comfortable with the underlying technology and their ability to convert the crypto into U.S. dollars. They would also need to decide which cryptocurrencies to accept. Bitcoin, Ether and USD Coin would probably be on their list,” Chason says. “There could certainly be more, but there are thousands of cryptocurrencies. No retailer could accept them all.”
Additional regulatory burdens could also create a headache for retailers.
“For example, Congress recently clarified that currency reporting requirements apply to crypto payments,” Chason says. “So, if a car dealership accepted crypto, it would need to report those payments like it would if it received physical cash.”
Businesses are more likely to use a third-party processor; BitPay is one of the more well-known.
“Many of them will take the customer’s crypto as payment and convert it into fiat currency for the retailer,” Chason says. “That removes the retailer from worries about handling the technology and price fluctuations.” He says the recent rise in stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar (referred to as USD Coins), might streamline this process.
“My guess is that this model will grow in the future. Customers could pay with volatile crypto, like Bitcoin, and a processor would convert it into a stablecoin, like a USD Coin, for the retailer,” Chason says.
What does the future look like for retailers and cryptocurrency?
Buck says what will really be a game changer is if the Federal Reserve creates its own central bank digital currency, also known as a CBDC. Numerous countries like the Philippines and the Bahamas have been looking into doing just that.
“We feel the real future of cryptocurrency would be having a CBDC, where you could have the advantages of cryptocurrency without the risk,” Buck says. “The CBDC could offer an important alternative to debit and credit cards.”
Until then, he says he wouldn’t encourage — or discourage — retailers from accepting crypto payments.
But it could behoove many business owners to continue researching cryptocurrencies and learning about them — and possibly ease into the crypto space without investing too much time and energy into it.
Because it’s probably coming. You’ve likely heard of the metaverse, the name that’s been given to the virtual reality world that is expected to become popular in the near future.
If virtual reality is a bigger thing someday than it already is, retailers might want to have digital storefronts in that world, and customers might want to pay with crypto.
“The metaverse is going to be a pretty large space,” Putra says. “It’s been around for a while already, only we didn’t call it that. We called it Xbox. But merchants are going to need to figure out how they engage in that space.”
Putra also thinks accountants and CFOs of the future are likely going to resemble IT departments, where they’ll have studied blockchain along with bookkeeping and budgeting.
The real question isn’t whether cryptocurrency will be accepted at retailers in the future. It’s how soon?
“All retailers are looking into it,” Buck says — Starbucks began accepting crypto payments for its coffee, and the Dallas Mavericks basketball team has been selling tickets for crypto for some time.
“This is coming, and we are aware of it, and I think retailers have seen the future, and we are ready to adjust,” Buck says. “And it could be a really good thing. But it has to be a value-added service for retailers rather than a possible loss.”"
338,2022-05-04,2022-05-04,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Bram Berkowitz,www.fool.com,3 Reasons Warren Buffett Still Doesn't Like Bitcoin,Buffett railed against Bitcoin at Berkshire Hathaway's recent annual meeting.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/05/04/3-reasons-warren-buffett-still-doesnt-like-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin (BTC 2.96%), the world's largest cryptocurrency, might be gaining acceptance from more and more players in the traditional financial system, but legendary investor Warren Buffett is still not a fan.
This attitude is nothing new from the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who has said on numerous occasions that he doesn't see anything special in the digital asset. At Berkshire's annual investor day on April 30, the Oracle of Omaha even said that if he were offered all the Bitcoin in the world for $25, he wouldn't take it. Here are three reasons Buffett feels this way.
1. Bitcoin doesn't produce anything tangible
One of the big reasons that Buffett told Berkshire's annual meeting that he wouldn't buy all of the Bitcoin in the world for $25 is, ""What would I do with it?"" He added:
Whether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don't know. But the one thing I'm pretty sure of is that it doesn't produce anything. ... It's got a magic to it, and people have attached magic to lots of things.
Buffett acknowledged that there are plenty of assets that don't necessarily produce anything tangible, like artwork. But if there is a piece of art that is created by an artist with a strong reputation and it's around long enough, somebody will likely find it interesting enough to purchase. He doesn't see Bitcoin as drawing that same interest. ""Assets, to have value, have to deliver something to somebody,"" he said.
2. It's not currency
Buffett doesn't believe Bitcoin is a currency. He said there is only one currency that is accepted in the U.S., which is the dollar. You can try to create any currency you want, Buffett said, but ""there's no reason in the world"" that the U.S. government would let any currency replace the dollar.
While I do believe Bitcoin and other digital currencies are likely here to stay in some capacity, I would agree with him that right now, Bitcoin is not really a currency, and I can't recall a time I've ever used it in a retail transaction.
But that doesn't mean Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency won't be used for retail purchases in the future. A study conducted by the website PYMNTS in May of 2021 found that 18% of the U.S. adult population (roughly 46 million people) said they would consider using cryptocurrencies for retail purchases.
Now, that could mean a wide variety of cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin that are better suited for payments, or even stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to a commodity or a currency. But there are more companies popping up every day that are encouraging people to use cryptocurrencies for everyday purchases, so I think it's possible that it will become more common.
3. He doesn't understand it
All of Buffett's comments continue to point to another reason he has cited in the past for his lack of enthusiasm for Bitcoin: He doesn't understand it.
This criticism ties back to a core Buffett investing theme: Never invest in a business you cannot understand. He isn't saying that you can't become an expert on a new business, but you have to be able to value the company or asset you are thinking about investing in -- and many, many investors have struggled to figure out how cryptocurrency works so they can value Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These digital assets can be complicated in the eyes of a beginner -- and many seasoned financial pros, as well."
339,2022-05-04,2022-05-03,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Aashna Dunwani,ambcrypto.com,Bitcoin to witness third market capitulation? The answer might amaze you,"At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at a red value of $38,410, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) making multiple attempts to head",https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-to-witness-third-market-capitulation-the-answer-might-amaze-you/,"In light of the ongoing bear market, BTC reached a monthly low of $37,614 after breaking its near-term support level of $38,000. Blockchain data and intelligence provider, Glassnode pointed out that a longer timeframe of holding onto the token without any profits in the near future may pave the way for the largest capitulation event that Bitcoin has ever experienced.
However, this is not the first time that Bitcoin would be undergoing market capitulation. BTC has undergone market capitulations in 2016 and 2018 after witnessing severe fluctuations for a period of 100 weeks.
Bitcoin in real-time
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at a red value of $38,410, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) making multiple attempts to head towards the neutral zone but constantly sticking around the 40-point range.
Upon taking into consideration the token’s movement in the last four months, Bitcoin, as of 2 May, held a Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio of 1.57 supporting the thesis that the token is currently held at a loss.
On 2 May, the number of active addresses also went up as compared to the number of active addresses on 1 May. The number of active addresses went up from 833,480 to 975,505 further strengthening the weightage of the above-mentioned analysis.
Can the Capitulation be avoided?
According to Wu Blockchain, the Bitcoin mining difficulty was raised from the block height 733,824. The mining difficulty rate shot up by 5.53% from 28.22 T to 29.79 T, with the current hashrate at 222 EH/s.
A rise in the hashrate means that more and more people are joining the network to mine the coin, thus strengthening the security of the token. However, with the current price trajectory of BTC coupled with the MVRV data, market capitulation seems inevitable.
Twitter users also seem to be anticipating the market capitulation given the nature of the tweets shared by various users. The Twitter account, PlanB tweeted about how Bitcoin has completed the entire cycle of a bull and bear market, and how the market still stands to be extremely sluggish.
Taking into consideration the movement of the market in the past few days, it can be stated that Bitcoin has taken Murphy’s law to heart. As it states, “Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong… and at the worst possible moment”, which seems like the most plausible outcome in this case."
340,2022-05-05,2022-05-05,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,David Pan,www.aljazeera.com,Bitcoin drops by most in almost a month as Fed optimism fades,"The largest digital currency fell as much as 8.4% to $36,639, the biggest intraday drop since April 11.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/5/5/bitcoin-drops-by-most-in-almost-a-month-as-fed-optimism-fades,"The largest digital currency fell as much as 8.4% to $36,639, the biggest intraday drop since April 11.
Bitcoin dropped the most in almost a month as the optimism seen across financial markets following the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday faded.
The largest digital currency fell as much as 8.4% to $36,639, the biggest intraday drop since April 11. It had gained 5.3% on Wednesday. Ether slumped as much as 7.2%. Avalanche and Solana, among some of the largest gainers after the U.S. central bank raised rates Wednesday, were down as much as 11% and 7.3%, respectively.
“The market still needs to digest the impact of tighter monetary policy on all risk assets and crypto might take a hit as correlations” with U.S. stocks increase, said Josh Lim, head of derivatives of New York-based brokerage Genesis Global Trading.
The U.S. central bank’s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday voted unanimously to increase the benchmark rate by a half percentage point and said it will begin allowing its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to roll off in June. Risky assets surged after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a 75-basis point increase is “not something that the committee is actively considering.”
Still, in this higher-rate environment, Bitcoin hasn’t been able to break out in any meaningful way beyond its highs at the start of the year. The coin has largely traded within a tight range over the past few months.
The “technical picture in BTC remains poor, in spite of a less hawkish Powell, BTC failed to regain 40,000, hence this pull back.” said Teong Hng, chief executive of Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Satori Research. “As equity markets in U.S. reversing yesterday’s gains, crypto follows suit.”
Money has been flowing out of the sector amid the malaise. Investors yanked roughly $120 million from crypto products last week, bringing total outflows over the past four weeks to $339 million, according to data tracked by fund provider CoinShares. Bitcoin last week accounted for the majority of the flows in what was its largest single week of outflows since June 2021."

Why it matters: 10 million people is a lot of people. That level of usage suggests that there really is demand for bitcoin from people who don't want to mess with weird wallets and keeping track of private keys.
For context, Glassnode estimates that there are a little under one million active bitcoin addresses right now, that is, people or entities holding their bitcoins on chain, under their own control.
It's believed that vastly more people hold cryptocurrencies using services like Cash App, where a few addresses control the bitcoin ultimately belonging to thousands of people.
Yes, but: Demand for the original cryptocurrency has flagged, somewhat. Bitcoin revenue was down 51% year over year, to $1.73 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Block made $43 million in profit off that revenue in Q1.
""The year-over-year decrease in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven primarily by relative stability in the price of bitcoin during the quarter,"" the report said.
Cash app primarily earns profit on bitcoin via the spread between buyers and sellers.
Details: This quarterly report highlighted some of Cash app's new bitcoin features:
It integrated with Bitcoin's lightning network, making payments to other lightning users nearly instantaneous.
""This new feature expands our peer-to-peer capabilities and presents an opportunity to strengthen our network with bitcoin while eliminating fees and processing times from sending bitcoin through on-chain transactions,"" the shareholder letter states.
In April, it allowed users who get their paycheck via direct deposit to automate receiving some of it in bitcoin without fees, similar to programs facilitated by Coinbase, the country's largest crypto exchange.
In the weeds: Bitcoin is always such a giant part of Cash app's revenue that it always has to give gross revenue numbers in total, and then excluding Bitcoin.
Bottomline: Cash app's gross profit was $624 million in Q1, better than all four prior quarters. All together, Block, Inc. earned $1.29 billion."

In Block number 735,000, mined at approximately 10:29 am UTC, Bitcoin crossed the halfway point to the next halving. The block was mined by Poolin, earning 0.16215354 BTC ($6,402.45) in fees.
Halvings occur every 210,00 blocks, and May 5 marks the cross-over point into the second leg of 105,000 blocks. For some Bitcoiners, such as Samson Mow, the Bitcoiner pioneering Bitcoin nation-state adoption, the halving is a reminder to stack more SATs:
WE ARE HALFWAY TO THE NEXT HALVING AND YOU HAVEN’T STACKED ENOUGH #BITCOIN YET. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 5, 2022
The halving cycle is a unique device that envelops the Bitcoin issuance rate. As the Cointelegraph Cryptopedia explains, “As a result of the halving cycle, the supply of available Bitcoin decreases, raising the value of Bitcoins yet to be mined.”
The halving is key in determining the supply of Bitcoin at 10:29 am UTC — which recently crossed the milestone 19 million mark — and the issuance rate, currently at 6.25 new BTC per roughly 10 minutes. In essence, roughly $250,000 worth of BTC is minted with every new block.
The next halving is due to take place in April 2024, and the previous halving occurred on May 11, 2020 as Bitcoin entered its fourth “epoch.” The system will continue until roughly 2140 when the last Bitcoin is mined.
The issuance rate and the ""supply shock"" that accompanies the halving have a significant impact on the price
As shown in the box above, the Bitcoin price has increased by a factor of 100 since the 2012 halving to reach the previous halving price. With current price levels around the $40,000 mark, the price has done another fourfold.

Its moves could trigger a recession and a loss of valuation for many assets including Bitcoin,https://interestingengineering.com/why-is-bitcoin-in-slump,"More than $128 billion in cryptocurrency market capitalization was wiped off in a matter of hours on Thursday after Bitcoin crashed eight percent, CNBC reported. Other crypto coins, ether and XRP, also saw sharp declines during this period.
Barely six months ago, Bitcoin was enjoying its historic high against the US dollar, and together cryptocurrencies were enjoying market capitalization that was leaving tech companies, including Apple, behind. That reality now sounds like a distant dream, with fears of a Bitcoin crash coming, even as the crypto coin trades at nearly half of its peak value.
Why is Bitcoin crashing?
For all the talk about opening doorways to decentralized finance, Bitcoin has become an asset that responds to perturbations of the current financial system. Analysis of macroeconomic trends over the years has shown that Bitcoin valuation behaves quite like Nasdaq stocks. Not because Bitcoin is linked to them, but because it falls into the same category of assets as stock, and monetary policies have a similar bearing on Bitcoin as they do at Nasdaq.
Earlier this week, when the U.S. Federal Reserve was expected to announce a tightening of its monetary position, crypto experts warned that Bitcoin could also come crashing down. While this was done on Wednesday, cryptocurrencies and stock markets saw a slight surge in value after the Fed dismissed rumors of a further increase in interest rates, CoinDesk reported.
However, the next day, the real impact of the Fed's decision to increase interest rates by 50 basis points was seen on Thursday, as Bitcoin crashed by as much as eight percent.
Where will Bitcoin go next?
Experts think that the Bitcoin slide to $36,251 seen on Thursday is not the whole picture, and the crypto coin could drop further in the coming days. The cryptocurrency may have fallen below a critical level when it crossed $37,500, and this could test its valuation to new lows, with a valuation of $25,000 also being a possibility. These plunges are fuelled by fears that future Fed moves to counter inflation might push the U.S. markets towards a recession.

If it is any solace for crypto enthusiasts, Nasdaq dropped by nearly 5 percent, and S&P500 lost almost four percent valuation the day Bitcoin slumped."

In a recent move observed by Whale Alert, a BTC holder executed a transfer worth $300 million from Coinbase.
The transaction, which was executed on 3 May 2022 at 22:50 UTC, is among the biggest crypto moves of May 2022. In a separate transfer on the same day at around 20:33 UTC, someone moved 7,794 Bitcoin from Coinbase to an unknown wallet.
The overall BTC balance on Coinbase has plunged in the past few months. According to a report published by Glassnode in March 2022, the Bitcoin balance on Coinbase has dipped by almost 36% in the last two years.
Similar to Coinbase, the trend of BTC outflows was observed across different digital asset trading platforms. However, some crypto trading platforms like FTX and Binance have witnessed a jump in the overall BTC supply since the start of 2021.
Bitcoin Sentiment
The current negative sentiment around Bitcoin has pushed the price of the world’s largest crypto asset to its lowest level since February 2022. According to Glassnode’s weekly on-chain analysis report, the percentage of Bitcoin entities in profit has decreased recently.
“The current market structure for Bitcoin remains in an extremely delicate equilibrium, with short-term price action and network profitability leaning bearish, whilst long-term trends remain constructive. The capitulation of Long-Term Holders appears to be continuing, with further evidence and analytical colour added to this concept this week,” Glassnode noted.
“Whether macro forces and correlations with traditional markets drag BTC lower remains to be seen, however numerous fundamental indicators approaching noteworthy points of undervaluation. There is a constructive confluence across numerous macro indicators, ranging from technical analysis (Mayer Multiple) to coin lifespan analysis (Reserve Risk, VDD Multiple), and even fundamental network health and utilisation (RVT Ratio),” the company added."
347,2022-05-06,2022-05-06,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Published,www.techtarget.com,Cryptocurrency mixer sanctioned over Lazarus Group ties,Blender.io is accused of aiding Lazarus Group hackers to obfuscate the movement of stolen Axie Infinity cryptocurrency.,https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252516845/Cryptocurrency-mixer-sanctioned-over-Lazarus-Group-ties,"The U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions against a cryptocurrency mixer accused of helping North Korean state-sponsored hackers launder cryptocurrency stolen from an attack on the Axie Infinity multiplayer game.
Investigators with the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control believe that hackers associated with North Korea's infamous Lazarus Group transferred around $20.5 million worth of money from hacked accounts through the Blender.io service as part of a cryptocurrency laundering scheme.
Under the terms of the sanctions, U.S. companies are blocked from doing business with Blender.io, and the company's U.S.-based assets have been frozen.
The sanctions come as investigators pry into the March attack on Sky Mavis, the makers of the NFT-focused game Axie Infinity, that is said to have lost some $600 million worth of cryptocurrency taken out of central accounts and moved into outside bankrolls.
Authorities attributed the Sky Mavis hack to North Korean state-sponsored hackers, who typically steal cryptocurrencies as a way to generate cash for military programs.
The state-sponsored Lazarus Group dates back more than half a decade, conducting sophisticated hacking operations for both propaganda purposes and fundraising opportunities.
Central to that effort is the use of cryptocurrency funds, which operate outside of the jurisdiction of global banking authorities. By obtaining money that can be laundered through cryptocurrency exchanges and mixers, the North Korean government can move funds without the worry of seizure by outside authorities under the extensive global sanctions imposed against the authoritarian regime.
Blender's $20.5 million of alleged laundering is only a small fraction of the $620 million stolen from Sky Mavis.
""Today, for the first time ever, Treasury is sanctioning a virtual currency mixer,"" said Brian E. Nelson, undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a press release Friday.
""Virtual currency mixers that assist illicit transactions pose a threat to U.S. national security interests. We are taking action against illicit financial activity by the DPRK and will not allow state-sponsored thievery and its money-laundering enablers to go unanswered.""
A key to making the pilfered funds look legitimate is the use of cryptocurrency mixers, and that is where the likes of Blender.io come in. By passing funds over multiple transactions, mixers are designed to obfuscate transactions and make it harder to track activity.
While there could be legitimate uses for mixer services, threats actors use them for money laundering and obfuscating the path of stolen funds from the source to the recipient by bouncing the transactions across multiple accounts and nodes.
This is what the Treasury Department believes Blender was doing with the Lazarus Group. The mixer is believed to have allowed the hackers to use the 'blending' service to make the movement of cryptocurrency stolen from hacked Axie Infinity servers appear to investigators as normal fund transfers.
As a result, Blender now finds itself under siege from the U.S. government and the site is classified as a ""significant threat to national security.""
""The virtual currency mixers that assist criminals are a threat to U.S. national security interests,"" the department said in the press release.
""Treasury will continue to investigate the use of mixers for illicit purposes and consider the range of authorities Treasury has to respond to illicit financing risks in the virtual currency ecosystem."""

Investors in bitcoin are in panic mode as the controversial terraUSD stablecoin slips further from its intended $1 peg. TerraUSD, otherwise known as UST, sank below 40 cents for the first time Wednesday, as holders continued to flee the token in what some have described as a ""bank run."" The token at one point fell as low as 31 cents, according to CoinGecko data. Created by Singapore-based Terraform Labs in 2018, UST is what's known as an ""algorithmic"" stablecoin. Part of the Terra blockchain project, it's meant to track the value of the dollar, like fellow stablecoins tether and USDC. However, unlike with those cryptocurrencies, Terra doesn't have cash and other assets held in a reserve to back its token. Instead, it uses a complex mix of code — alongside a sister token called luna — to stabilize prices. UST is important for bitcoin investors as Luna Foundation Guard, an organization supporting the Terra project, is sitting on billions of dollars in bitcoin that could potentially be dumped onto the market at any point. ""Every professional investor in crypto has one eye on UST today, watching to see if it can maintain its peg to the dollar,"" said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management. ""There's clearly significant risk in the market.""
In simple terms, the Terra protocol destroys and creates new units of UST and luna to adjust supply. When the price of UST falls below the dollar, it can be taken out of circulation and exchanged for luna, making UST's supply more scarce and boosting its price — at least, that's how it should work in theory. To further complicate things, Terra's creator, Do Kwon, bought $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin to provide a backstop for UST in times of crisis. The theory was that UST could eventually be redeemed for bitcoin instead of luna, but this is untested and hasn't yet been put into practice. Deposits into Anchor, Terra's flagship lending protocol, have declined from 10.3 billion tokens on May 6 to just 6.4 billion Tuesday, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen. Anchor offered users an almost 20% annual percentage yield on their UST holdings, a rate many analysts believe was unsustainable."

352,2022-05-10,2022-05-10,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Andrew R. Chow,time.com,Why Bitcoin Keeps Crashing,The current slide of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is being caused by a combination of short-term and long-term factors.,https://time.com/6175370/why-bitcoin-crashing/,"Bitcoin took a brutal fall on Monday, briefly dipping below $30,000 for the first time since July 2021. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is now worth less than half of what it was in the fall. Other cryptocurrencies, like Ether and BNB, have seen similar falls, while trading volumes have also tapered off on major exchanges. Some experts are now warning of a “crypto winter,” in which the sector’s astonishing growth is replaced by an extended period of contraction.
The current slide of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is being caused by a combination of short-term and long-term inputs, including larger financial markets and the crashing of a major stablecoin. Here are some of the main factors leading to the current slump.
Bitcoin is connected to the rest of the financial market.
Crypto evangelists have long hoped that the independent nature of crypto would make it resistant to inflation and crises. Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has no central issuer or authority controlling it. That independence from government, many argued, should ensure that Bitcoin would hold its value through economic dips, international wars or drastic policy changes.
But the last couple of years have proven this is false. When the coronavirus pandemic crushed global markets in March 2020, so too fell Bitcoin, falling by 57%. Stock markets and cryptocurrencies then both recovered and rose at a staggering rate, which analysts believe was caused by a combination of free time, disposable income, and pandemic-relief money pumped into the world by governments.
But lately, investors have been wary that change is in the air, as inflation led the Federal Reserve and other central banks to raise interest rates. For investors looking for a safe port, Bitcoin, which swings wildly by nature, may seem too risky.
Bitcoin’s fall comes on the heels of the Dow and Nasdaq’s worst single-day declines since 2020, as well as the S&P 500 hitting its nadir in the past year. The market has been unsettled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has exacerbated inflation, supply chain issues and oil prices. Slowed growth in China amidst COVID-19 outbreaks there are also contributing to financial anxieties. Some crypto evangelists predict that Bitcoin’s price will decouple from the stock market down the road—but for now, the two are very much intertwined.
Crypto is inherently volatile.
Even the biggest crypto boosters will tell you that success in the crypto world is far from guaranteed. Its volatility is part of its very appeal to many speculators: that they could make money at rates far faster than that of normal stock brokers.
But with the promise of the boom also comes that of the bust. Since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, there have been several major bear- and bull- cycles, with short-term investors alternately flooding the market and then losing interest. Many exchanges, especially during high times, offer inherently risky propositions, allowing traders to invest with borrowed crypto. If prices start to drop, whether due to big investors selling off their shares or other reasons, a lack of actual cash flow can contribute to even faster free-falls.
More from TIME
The volume of people investing in crypto at any given time is highly variable as well: More than half of traders who held crypto at the end of 2021 had only entered the market that year, according to crypto firm Grayscale Investments. And it’s no accident that crypto crashes tend to occur over weekends. That’s when investors tend to tune out, so the ones who are making trades can make bigger waves.
Worries about regulation and security breaches
Given that crypto derives some of its value from people’s belief in it, markets can be rattled by surrounding skepticism or policy changes. China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining in mid-2021, for example, led to Bitcoin crashing from $65,000 in April to $35,000 in June. The total market capitalization of crypto similarly fell around that time when Elon Musk announced Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin for payments in May 2021, citing environmental reasons.
Many crypto investors have watched anxiously as governments of countries central to crypto trading or mining—including the U.S., China, India and Germany—have moved toward regulation. Meanwhile, crypto has been shaken by a wave of hacks and security breaches, including a $600 million hack of the Ethereum sidechain Ronin. These hacks have shaken consumer confidence in crypto and slowed growth from new potential buyers entering the field.
The number of real-world use cases that would bring newcomers into the crypto space seems to be slowing this year, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, told CBS News. “There’s a belief that mainstream adoption [of Bitcoin] is taking a lot longer than people expected,” Moya said. “Right now, what we’re seeing is that the crypto market is in a wait-and-see mode.”
UST
Some experts also believe that the recent struggles of UST, TerraUSD, one of the largest stablecoins, played a role in the most recent Bitcoin crash. TerraUSD, also known as UST, is a token that is designed to always be worth $1, but sank below 70 cents on Monday as holders panicked and sold off their tokens en masse in a pseudo-bank-run.
In order to defend UST’s price, the Luna Foundation Guard, which safeguards the stablecoin, drained its $1.3 billion bitcoin reserve and bought $850 million more in Bitcoin. “That [action could] add meaningful sell pressure on bitcoin and could drag down markets with it,” Corey Miller, growth lead at dYdX, told TechCrunch. Caleb Franzen, a senior market analyst at Cubic Analytics, explained in the same article that “historically negative performance” and “historically negative sentiment” can lead to “continued selloff,” which impacts prices negatively.
Big picture
Whether the crypto slide continues remains to be seen. Some believe that things will only get worse as more and more investors panic. But after the price of Bitcoin dropped below $30,000, its price corrected when evangelists “bought the dip,” or entered the market at a discounted rate. They believe that amidst its day-to-day turbulence, Bitcoin will continue its zoomed-out growth pattern that it has displayed over the last decade.

Immediately following the first transaction, a seller swapped $85 million of UST for USDC on Curve, and pushed the UST-3pool, which held UST, USDC, USDT and DAI stablecoins, out of balance.
The seller dumped the UST at a pace that exceeded marginal demand, creating a positive feedback loop that brought the price of UST down to 98 cents.
LFG loaned $1.5 billion from the reserve to traders tasked to restore the peg, and almost succeeded in bringing UST back to $1.
When traditional markets opened Monday and continued to sell off, the original short seller apparently continued with its market swaps on Curve, knowing that few buyers would want to step in to save the algorithmic stablecoin."

Bitcoin swung between gains and losses after tumbling to an almost 11-month low, while the TerraUSD stablecoin continued its downward spiral.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value fell as much as 6.2% to $29,085 before trading little changed. Analysts had been watching the $30,000 level as a key threshold, with many projecting that losses could accelerate once the coin falls below it.
Meanwhile, the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin continued to spiral lower, trading at less then 30 cents. Backers of the coin are trying to raise about $1.5 billion to shore up the token after it crashed from its dollar peg, according to the founder of a firm that was approached about the deal.
“Bitcoin and cryptos have become a risk-on/risk-off trade this year and the CPI data is a risk-off development,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “As for Terra, this news is having an impact as well. Its collapse is lower confidence in an asset class that has been losing confidence among investors all year.”
Other cryptocurrencies also fell, with Bitcoin Cash losing more than 11% and Dash dropping nearly 16%.
The drop came after data showed US consumer prices rose by more than forecast in April, indicating inflation will persist at elevated levels for longer. The data point also suggests the Federal Reserve will stay on its path of aggressive interest-rate hikes.
“There is extreme fear across the crypto market,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the UK-based digital-asset broker GlobalBlock. “In addition to ongoing macro headwinds, there is now a fundamental risk to the crypto industry as the UST stablecoin has de-pegged from $1.”
Cryptocurrencies and other riskier assets have been under pressure all year. The Federal Reserve and other central banks are raising interest rates to fight red-hot inflation, creating an unfavorable environment for risk assets.
The area around $30,000 had been an “especially sensitive zone,” for Bitcoin, wrote James Malcolm, head of foreign exchange and crypto research at UBS. That’s where mining economics turn negative, “ which could potentially lead to increased coin sales by this key cohort,” he said. He added that long-term accumulators like MicroStrategy Inc. begin to fall below historical breakevens.
“Below this there is little technical support until the low-20ks, where margin calls kick in,” Malcolm wrote.
Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index is now at 21, showing that it’s at its most oversold since January. The coin now needs to hold $28,000. A break below that level could start a new wave of selling.
Still, a lot of crypto investors, cognizant of the fact that Bitcoin has gone through a boom-and-bust cycle before only to recoup losses over and over again, are preaching patience.
“Ultimately every investor needs to size positions based on their risk level and time horizon,” said Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at Ninepoint Partners. “We believe Bitcoin will recover and that we’re still in the early stages of this new internet of value. Keep calm and HODL.”

Here are some cryptocurrency myths and facts every investor should know.
Some will praise cryptocurrency as being a new alternative to traditional currency. Many will claim that it is one of the best investments you could ever make. On the other hand, some people believe that cryptocurrency isn’t here to stay and that it will implode and lose all value once the bubble bursts.
What are the facts about cryptocurrency, and what are the myths? Should you really invest in cryptocurrency, or should you stay away from it? Keep reading to learn all this and more as we go over eight cryptocurrency myths and facts that you should know before investing in it.
Myth – Bitcoin and The Blockchain are Interchangeable
Fact – Each Cryptocurrency Has Its Own Blockchain (For the Most Part)
Many people don’t fully understand what a blockchain is, which has led to a lot of myths surrounding its nature. A blockchain is like a virtual ledger that cryptocurrencies are built and traded on. Though there are exceptions, each cryptocurrency has its own blockchain and can only be traded on that blockchain. This means that you wouldn’t be able to go to the Ethereum blockchain and trade Bitcoin on it or vice versa.
Also, keep in mind that different blockchains function differently. For example, the blockchain is created to make Bitcoin work like digital cash in Bitcoin’s case. On the other hand, Ethereum was created to allow developers to build peer-to-peer apps that don’t need an intermediary to work in addition to the blockchain itself.
You should take away from all of this because there are multiple cryptocurrencies; they each have their own blockchain in most cases and function as separate entities. The blockchain is not the cryptocurrency itself, but rather a platform that allows you to use the cryptocurrency.
Myth – Cryptocurrencies Aren’t Regulated
Fact – Cryptocurrencies Are Becoming More Regulated Each Year
When cryptocurrencies first appeared, it really was like the wild west since no laws or regulations had been created to regulate them. As a result, some people were wary because they thought governments would simply crackdown and ban cryptocurrencies rather than regulate them. However, as time has passed, things have started to change, and governments have begun looking at ways to regulate cryptocurrency rather than ban it outright.
One of the reasons for this approach is that huge businesses like Amazon, Dell, and Twitch have started to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment option. Since these companies have a lot of influence across many nations, world governments are more open to working with cryptocurrencies rather than against them.
Myth – Cryptocurrencies are Illegal in Areas Where They’re Not Regulated
Fact – Not Being Regulated Doesn’t Necessarily Make Cryptocurrency Illegal
Just because something is unregulated doesn’t make it illegal. For example, you and your friends could invent a form of currency that you use just between yourselves. It could be anything really, and it wouldn’t be illegal just because it isn’t regulated. Thanks, basically how it is with cryptocurrency.
An excellent example of this is the situation in South Africa. The South African Reserve Bank is working on drafting laws and regulations for cryptocurrencies, but currently, cryptocurrency is not considered legal tender. But, of course, it doesn’t make them illegal either; it just means that SARB doesn’t back cryptocurrencies.
The main thing to remember is that if you have any questions about whether cryptocurrencies are legal or regulated in your area, there is plenty of information to clear things up for you. Just make sure you get your info from a legit source, as you would with anything related to legal issues.
Myth – The Blockchain is Only Useful for Cryptocurrencies
Fact – The Blockchain has Many Uses
Once again, people tend to misunderstand the true nature of the blockchain. It isn’t just a wallet for cryptocurrencies online; it’s an entire platform that can provide multiple functions. In addition, people are coming up with new innovations for the blockchain that give it additional functionality.
One good example of how the blockchain can do more than store and trade cryptocurrency is the fact that it can also host contracts between two or more parties. This can be a big help in various cases, such as storing the contract between a loan company, and the beneficiary. It can even make the loan payments automatic if so desired.
Myth – Cryptocurrency is Used For Criminal Purposes
Fact – All Currencies are Used for Criminal Purposes, Crypto is No Different
Some people are under the impression that cryptocurrencies were created to conduct criminal business and fund criminal enterprises. However, this is not the case. A report from Chainalysis indicates that around 1% of crypto is used for illegal activity, a decrease from previous years.
Cryptocurrencies can and will be used for criminal purposes, but the same can be said of all currencies. The fact that crypto has only 1% used for illegal activity is pretty impressive, considering how traditional currencies are used.
Myth – Cryptocurrency Makes You Anonymous
Fact – Cryptocurrency Can Make Tracing Your Identity Much Harder, But Not Impossible
One of the reasons people associate cryptocurrency with criminal activities is that they think using crypto makes you anonymous. The truth is that it doesn’t, not entirely anyway. While cryptocurrency can make it incredibly difficult to trace transactions and discover a person’s identity, there are ways to do it since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
If you’re concerned with privacy, you should be pleased to know that cryptocurrency is one of the most secure payment methods globally. This lets you make transactions without fear of hackers or other nefarious forces getting your information and discovering your identity.
However, it should be noted that an exceptionally skilled hacker or government agency can still get into the information on the blockchain and discover a person’s identity. Interestingly enough, this is rarely done by hacking the blockchain directly, but through more indirect methods that target a person’s account, such as password phishing.
This means that protecting one’s identity while using cryptocurrency comes primarily down to following basic Internet security procedures like choosing a unique password, being careful what networks you access while using cryptocurrency, and not clicking on suspicious links in emails.
Myth – Cryptocurrency Has No True Value Because a Commodity doesn’t back it
Fact – Cryptocurrency Doesn’t Need to Be Backed by a Commodity to Have Value
This is one of the most persistent myths about cryptocurrency, but the value is subjective by its very nature, and this is especially true when it comes to currency. This has led some to claim that crypto doesn’t have an intrinsic value because it isn’t backed by a commodity such as silver or gold as many fiat currencies supposedly are. However, this fails to account for the fact that these days, fiat currencies aren’t backed by commodities either, and the commodities themselves possess no intrinsic objective value.
The value of cryptocurrency comes from the value that the buyers and sellers give it. That said, it is also subject to economic forces that influence the value as well, such as the fact that the more cryptocurrency there is, the lower its value will become. Even so, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are not infinite, making them a more stable form of currency than a fiat currency in which more can always be created.
Myth – The Cryptocurrency Bubble is Going to Burst Soon
Fact – Cryptocurrency Has Steadily Gained in Value Over the Past Decade
The first cryptocurrencies were seen back in 2010, and since then, most have steadily gained in value, with Bitcoin being a good example. Yes, there have been peaks and valleys, but any currency can say the same. Will the cryptocurrency bubble burst soon? Recent findings seem to indicate that it is unlikely.
Something that needs to be taken into account when discussing the supposed cryptocurrency bubble is that it has recently become the world’s 5th most circulated currency. In fact, between 2020 and 2021, crypto experienced an average increase in value of 195%, which is pretty astounding.
Myth – Cryptocurrencies are for criminals, and criminals are fickle
Fact – That’s not true
Just because some people break laws with cryptocurrencies, it doesn’t mean everyone who uses it is the wrong person to fund organized crime. We all use cash, paychecks, and credit cards. Criminals use those currency systems, too; the fact that criminals use something shouldn’t condemn that item as bad.
Myth- Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender
Fact – This is not entirely true
It might not be legal, but cryptocurrency exchange is legal, and regulations vary from state to state and are dependent on the transaction. Cryptocurrency regulations state that it is a legal tender in such cases, where it is accepted. In addition, blockchain systems can manage and increase government transparency, as many governmental organizations adopt blockchain auditing as a public service.
Myth – Cryptocurrency is hackable
Fact – Unlike banking apps and fitness trackers, blockchain is highly secure
As with regular cryptocurrencies, the miners of the blockchain system are put in a confidential mode where they offer their abilities to solve some test transactions in compromising situations.
Myth – Only rich people would use cryptocurrencies
Fact: People who earn lots of money think differently from the poor people who face financial problems
Still, cryptocurrencies received a thousand+ businesses’ acceptance and are used by those who may not have much money. Cryptocurrencies are used in everyday purchases and non-financial transactions. If a dollar is too much for some, bitcoin is enough for many others. More businesses accepting Cryptocurrencies is not a social issue since transaction fees for people who don’t use cash are zero or minimal.
Myth – Cryptocurrency is bad for planning
Fact – Many businesses use programmed software dealing with business calculations, auditing, and accounting
Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that keeps the transactions assured through cryptography and transparency don’t hinder net business businesses, logistic business traders, or financial trades.
Myth – Cryptocurrencies can never be used in a business
Fact – Blockchain technology creates a great platform to conduct transactions and cash flow in businesses
It has immense features to handle cash flow; as with cryptocurrencies, there isn’t any need for a third party to manage transaction codes. Cryptocurrencies make business management more effortless.
Myth – The cryptocurrency capacity is unlimited
Fact – Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are mined and finite
When the blockchain space has reached its full capacity, attaining more power is difficult since processing power takes time measured in hours and not days, weeks, or even years.
Myth – Cryptocurrencies are not real donations but purchases; they are based on an artificial medium that’s derivatives at best
Fact – Bitcoin is not ‘an artificial medium
It’s an ‘electronic cash address where every person gets their private keys (wallets). Money generated and earned purchases by handling cryptocurrency brings value to the currency and has real worth. Without buying and selling, cryptocurrencies melt away into oblivion like Bitcoin Cash.
Is Crypto Right For You?
If you’re looking for a way to make digital payment online easier, then there is no reason not to hop aboard the cryptocurrency train. Once you understand how it works, it can make online payments fast, easy, and convenient. Many people use crypto just for a fact because it’s highly secure and safe to use.
On the other hand, if you want to be a serious cryptocurrency investor, you need to understand what crypto is and the economic forces behind it. While cryptocurrency is a legit investment, there is a bit more to it than just purchasing some and hoping it rises in value as a stock would.
If you want to invest in crypto, now is a great time. Just make sure you do your research first, and make an informed decision. Do this, and you won’t regret it.

The number of Bitcoin wallets falling in unrealized losses increased to 15.5% in April 2022.
Analysts have called a bottom of $29,000 for Bitcoin price and predict a recovery within three months.
Bitcoin price recently plummeted after witnessing massive volatility and a bloodbath in the crypto market. There is a rise in the number of Bitcoin wallets that suffered unrealized losses and addresses underwater.
40% Bitcoin holders are underwater after recent price drop
Bitcoin price dropped 55% from its peak in November 2021. The drop in Bitcoin price has pushed several wallet addresses underwater. Underwater is a term used to describe addresses that hold assets that were purchased above the current price.
Based on data from Glassnode, 40% of Bitcoin holders are currently underwater, after the Bitcoin price slipped to $30,000. The asset has hit its lowest level in a year, and experts believe the risk-off approach of investors could trigger a further Bitcoin price drop.
Glassnode noted a massive influx of “urgent transactions” in the ongoing BTC sell-off, where investors have paid premiums to expedite transaction times. The total fees paid for on-chain transactions hit their highest point yet, at 3.07 BTC.
Analysts believe the dominance of on-chain transaction fees and the rising exchange deposits signal a growing sense of urgency amongst investors. $3.15 billion in Bitcoin has flown in and out of exchanges over the past week, hitting a new all-time high since the November 2021 peak.
A higher number of addresses underwater combined with urgency to sell and BTC inflow to exchanges implies a rise in selling pressure and downward squeeze on price.
Whale wallets with a balance of over 10,000 Bitcoins have witnessed a particular rise in the distribution of their BTC across the network. Retail investors with less than 1 BTC have emerged as the strongest holders, close to levels observed in February 2022.
Analysts at Fundstrat Global Advisors evaluated the Bitcoin price trend and called a bottom of around $29,000. Analysts believe Bitcoin price could witness a trend reversal within the next three months.
@crypto_noble, a crypto analyst and host of The Market Update, believes Bitcoin price could resume its uptrend if price crosses resistance at $32,500. However, failure to break past resistance could push BTC to $28,000."

When I tell the customs official I’m going to Miami for the Bitcoin 2022 conference, there seems to be a light in the man’s eyes. He peppers me with questions, even though I’d gotten up at 5 am that day to fly, and my smartwatch is telling me that my energy levels are only at 70%. The customs official has way more interest in the subject than I can handle.
Why am I going to the conference? The philosophy of the event fascinates me — it’s a Bitcoin-only conference — with the divide between Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency world growing year by year.
I don’t go into that much detail with the customs official, though. Sometimes, when I interact with too many crypto people, I forget that everyone else has paid so little attention to this space, they still use the terms “Bitcoin” and “cryptocurrency” synonymously. If I offload onto the customs official everything that’s on my mind, he’d probably think I’m autistic or drunk (or maybe both).
Florida state of mind
I’ve always found Miami strange, but not in a bad way. Florida is known for the Florida Man meme — all the wild and wacky stuff happening in the Sunshine State like the naked man downtown who bit off someone’s face in 2012. But that’s largely because of Florida’s strong information-transparency laws. As a fellow journalist, I dream about this sometimes. Where I’m from, Canada, we have to fight twice as hard for half the disclosure. Florida is brash and loud because it’s open. In a way, Florida is America.

Indeed, writing in The Globe and Mail newspaper, journalist David Shribman would later say that the American center used to be California, which gave the world the movie theatre, skateboards and the linguistic filler “like.” Now, Shribman writes, America’s center is Florida. The state is the home of former-President Donald Trump, but it used to be governed by the moderate Jeb Bush — in a way encapsulating the transformation of American conservatism of the last decade. Florida is home to the “Stand Your Ground” self-defense law, the rebellion against COVID-19 mask mandates and, of course, Disneyland. No wonder this libertarian fantasy world is attracting Bitcoiners and the tech elite.
Out of California and into Florida, PayPal’s Peter Thiel has made the move. So has another member of the so-called “PayPal Mafia,” the venture capitalist Keith Rabois. Elon Musk, too, has a SpaceX launch site in Florida, and Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest has moved to the state as well. Somewhere in there is also why Bitcoin 2022, the Bitcoin-only conference that excludes other cryptocurrencies, has come to this state.
Note how so many of these tech people moving to Florida are also Bitcoin people — not just in the eyes of the mainstream who use “Bitcoin” and “cryptocurrency” interchangeably, but Bitcoin-only Bitcoin people. Thiel and Wood were both listed as speakers at Bitcoin 2022. Perhaps that’s only natural.
We're in Miami, Bitcoin! Check out this #Bitcoin2022 recap to see what leaders, developers, celebrities, and builders did throughout the four-day event in Miami. https://t.co/mQahMG2Au4 pic.twitter.com/rEZYoPjaTv — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) April 14, 2022
During the conference, one of its hosts Natalie Brunell, speaking on the venture capitalist Anthony Pompliano’s podcast, says Bitcoin represents the “American Dream,” with its ethos of “self-determination, freedom, the idea of creating a better life for your family.” But it’s not just that. That reputation of the Bitcoin-only folks — often called maximalists — is much like that of the new America that Florida has come to represent. It’s loud. It’s big on individual liberties. The open blockchain is transparent to a fault. Thus, Bitcoin is Florida.
Or, at least, that’s one idea. On a different episode of the same Pompliano podcast, an enlightening statistic is brought up: 83% of those who own Bitcoin also own another cryptocurrency. For all of Bitcoin’s distinctness and how its identity is separate from the rest of crypto, that does not seem to extend to its holders. As I go about this Bitcoin-only event in the heart of this new America, I would wonder, How organic, really, is this maximalism sentiment running through it all?
Bitcoin to the max
It’s hardly a controversial thought to say that other cryptocurrencies cannot be truly compared to Bitcoin because they are not sufficiently decentralized — and decentralization is the entire point of the first cryptocurrency. Nor is it outlandish to say that most of the tens of thousands of alternative coins and random “blockchain” projects are either scams or, to put it politely, overly ambitious. But Bitcoin maximalists have been criticized for taking that idea up a notch.
On the second day of the conference, there is a zinger thrown during the panel called “Wartime Bitcoin.” The moderator asks what the biggest attack on Bitcoin is. Aleks Svetski, an Australian entrepreneur and author of a book on individual liberties, isn’t first in line to speak. But he seemingly gets invigorated by the question. Svetski gestures at the moderator and another speaker. “Let me go first, please,” he says. Svetski speaks with his hands:
“The attack is cryptocurrency. That’s the fucking attack.”

The crowd cheers. Or, at least, some people do. I can hear the hoots. That is indeed quite clever, I think to myself as I watch Svetski. He further explains his thinking:
“The easiest way to Trojan Horse everyone is to pretend like you’re building something technically and architecturally similar [to Bitcoin] and add a fucking wonderboy… and then roll it out to the lemmings.”
Such rhetoric, though — those who disagree with it, disagree strongly. As the conference goes on, widely followed Twitter account Autism Capital tweets, “We find it incredibly interesting how the majority of the talks at Bitcoin Miami are people justifying Bitcoin against Ethereum…. It’s not a conference, it’s a sermon.”
We find it incredibly interesting how the majority of the talks at Bitcoin Miami are people justifying Bitcoin against Ethereum. The fear is real. It’s not a conference, it’s a sermon. “Trust in God, do not be tempted, he will protect you, do not dance with the devil’s ether.” — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) April 8, 2022
Indeed, at Bitcoin 2021, the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. was booed when he showed up promoting an Ethereum-based project. Mayweather obviously didn’t do a good job of reading the room. And the boos were perhaps justified, given what happened to the
Ethereum Max token he was promoting to the outside world. But what was on display at Bitcoin 2021 bordered on the religious. A Rolling Stone article on the event was headlined “Welcome to the Church of Bitcoin.”
But I didn’t go to Bitcoin 2021. I only read about it. In person, at Bitcoin 2022, there was much less of that image of Bitcoin maximalism than I expected. Aside from the conference speakers and, I guess, the guys who cheered Svetski, whom I didn’t really see, I would meet very few people who are actual Bitcoin maximalists. In fact, walking in and out of the formal talks and the rest of the conference, it seems as if I am stepping into different worlds.

Four days in Miami
The conference at the Miami Beach Exhibition Center is altogether four days, with the first being reserved for industry, the second and third for general admission, and the fourth for a music event called the Sound Money Fest.
The way the conference is structured is that there are a few big rooms with stages for the formal events such as the talks, and while those are going on, there is a massive exhibition floor with hundreds of booths by various companies and organizations. There are also quite a few bars strewn around the place.
Everywhere, there are a lot of spectacles around — aside from the celebrity speakers like Jordan Peterson and Serena Williams. There is a cyborg bull statue outside mimicking the golden one that stands on Wall Street. Inside, on the exhibition floor, there is another bull that you can ride, a mechanical one operated by the exchange Bullish. The person who lasts the longest at the conference would win a whole Bitcoin.
The exhibition hall also has a Bitcoin volcano, referencing geothermal powered Bitcoin mining in El Salvador, and beside it is a stage with a table set up like at the sports network ESPN. Various personalities would sit around that table throughout the day and give their hot takes.
I spend part of my first day in the exhibition hall trying to look for the booth of this Ukrainian mining pool Hiveon. A publicist reached out to me earlier and said a lot about the company’s involvement in the ongoing war with Russia — Ukraine raised more than $100 million in crypto. I found that link fascinating, how crypto found its way into this big geopolitics conversation. Much of that was based on Ethereum, however, not Bitcoin.
To give you an idea of how big the exhibition hall is, though, and how absurdly bustling with activity it is, I never really end up finding the company.
With 20,000 people from around the world descending on Miami Beach, all the celebrity speakers, the global media attention — it’s hard to believe all of that came out of a white paper by a pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto 13 years ago.
It’s easy to see, though, that certain diffusion that happens as all ideas take hold. As Bitcoin grew, the border between it and the wider world blurred — when it became more mainstream, it also became more mainstream.
“Crypto” used to be synonymous with “Bitcoin” because there were no other coins. It was all about peer-to-peer money that can’t be controlled by any one party. When more people paid attention to it, they as much started to become influenced by that idea as they started to influence that idea. The result is the tens of thousands of different coins, the Ethereum network and its clones and competitors, the pictures of apes selling for hundreds of thousands, the “blockchain” movement hoping to tap the technology but not the coin, and the scams and the hacks. That is the term “crypto” as we know it today.

At the core of it all, there’s still that Bitcoin-only movement, still focused on that singular original idea of peer-to-peer digital money. But they seem to be getting drowned out. Even at this conference that is ostensibly all about Bitcoin maximalism, the exhibition hall is flush with the sort of “crypto” companies that the speaker Svetski would call the biggest attack on Bitcoin.
The Ukrainian mining pool Hiveon, for example, whose booth I eventually later found, is for Ethereum. Some at the conference are openly selling NFTs. A writer for The Defiant, a DeFi publication, even says, “I see signs that DeFi is taking root in the heart of Bitcoin.” As I go about the exhibition hall, I ask myself, Aside from some of the conference speakers, where are all these Bitcoin maximalists I keep hearing so much about?
Much later, I get somewhat of an answer. At the conference, I ran into a team from the media company WGMI Studios that has been going around interviewing attendees. Among the questions it asked is “Bitcoin or Ethereum?” They later compiled the results for me. Out of 298 people, even at this Bitcoin-only conference, 22% said Ethereum, and 11% said both. One of the WGMI studios guys, Nathan Espinosa, tells me later: “We also asked people, ‘NFTs, yes or no?’ toward the end of the event… It was quite interesting to see how [even some of who] chose Bitcoin and talked down Ethereum still supported NFTs.”

More bull
On the third day, I see the mechanical bull again, the one on the expo floor that anyone can try to ride to win a Bitcoin. I quickly Google the tips and tricks on how to ride a mechanical bull and sign up. How hard can riding a mechanical bull be? I last four seconds.
I turn to less-physical pursuits after that. I play “Lightning” chess where players have only about five minutes to make all of their movies. I lost two games and won two games, which I think is a respectable finish.
What I truly gain from that chess experience, though, is a spreadsheet of all the side-parties going on that an opponent gave me. Among the 32 events on just the third conference day, there is a yacht party or two and a beach event by Maxim magazine — just to give you an idea of what was on offer.
ETHMiami’s party is, unfortunately, miserable with under a dozen people. I am there for no more than 10 minutes before chugging my beer and walking out.
A much better party — and one with an open bar — seems to be one by this outfit called Bad Bitch Empire, which bills itself as a private crypto investment club for ambitious women. Yet the promised free drinks turn out to be a mirage, and there are way too many people all squeezed shoulder to shoulder on a tiny rooftop patio.
I go around asking people about my observation, that, somehow, at this Bitcoin-only conference, I’ve encountered so few Bitcoin maximalists. A man who works at a Bitcoin ATM provider tells me he feels the maximalists are vocal but not necessarily in the majority. Where are the maxis at the conference? “I don’t know, but I see them only on Twitter,” he tells me. Everyone seems to agree with my observation.
I also bump into someone from SpaceX, but it turned out he wasn’t an attendee at Bitcoin 2022. In fact, quite few people at those side-parties were, and that’s what strikes me. One sullen British guy, who works at a crypto hedge fund, tells me that the conference is not the point. It’s the meetings you have with all the people who are in town, he says.
I guess he has a point. The conference talks are streamed online anyway. If you’re solely after the information presented, you don’t even need to leave your bedroom. It’s the human connection with the hordes of other crypto folks all in one place that is the real point of such events. So, why pay $1,099 if you can just hobnob for free at the side parties?
That night at the Bad Bitch Empire event, Bitcoin 2022 itself doesn’t really stand out among the dozens of crypto events going on around it — the Maxim beach party, the yacht gatherings, even that little ETHMiami gathering, as unspectacular as it was. It’s kind of like how, at the conference itself, its theme of Bitcoin maximalism seemed so lost among the wider crypto presence — even if, without Bitcoin 2022, there would have been none of these side events promising free drinks.

The final hours
On the last day, at the Sound Money Music Festival that is to cap off the conference, I speak to a trio of friends who are the absolute opposite of Bitcoin maximalists. One of them, a graphic designer who has gone into NFTs, an artist who goes by WHUT, proudly tells me that he holds no Bitcoin at all.
When I press him, he says, “I have, but it is like a fraction. It doesn’t really make sense to even speak about it. But I do have — my bag in Tezos is pretty heavy. I own like over 70 NFTs.” As an artist, he says, that’s what he gravitated toward. He adds that all the altcoins have advanced the crypto mission that began with Bitcoin.
Another among the trio, a recording artist named Cassius Cuvée, says:
“Mass adoption — by way of Web3 — is by NFTs. Artists are driving the adoption… You can’t have Web3 with only Bitcoin, basically.”
Whatever you make of their view, you can’t dispute that these guys believe it, and they’re not alone among the thousands of attendees of what is supposed to be a Bitcoin-only conference.
It might seem, on the surface, that the conclusion to draw would be that this Bitcoin-only conference is becoming pointless. But the other perspective is that the very existence of all these non-maximalists validates this conference’s purpose. What’s the point, after all, of spreading maximalism if everyone is already a maximalist? Maybe the hordes of non-maximalist crypto people of the past days are exactly the sort of attendees the Bitcoin 2022 organizers want.

“Crypto” once meant “Bitcoin.” Now crypto has grown to become not only a world of which Bitcoin is only a small part, but also one which Bitcoin doesn’t really want to belong. To some, that’s a natural progression. To others, it’s a perversion. But to everyone, it’s a process that is plainly happening. Therein must lie the true raison d’être of the conference, its reason for being what it is: to counter that rising tide, to play the yang to the growing yin.
It’s hard to say how successful that mission statement is, but like how people say any publicity is good publicity, what matters in any endeavor isn’t so much how far you go but that you take a little step each day and do not stop. Exposing all those thousands of crypto folks to maximalist thought — maybe that in itself is a victory."

TerraUSD, or UST, plunged to as low as 26 cents. The so-called stablecoin is meant to maintain a 1-to-1 peg with the U.S. dollar. It was last trading at around 68 cents, according to Coin Metrics data.
Sister token luna, which has a floating price and is meant to serve as a kind of shock absorber for UST, at one point dived to less than 90 cents before recovering slightly to $1.18. The coin has lost roughly 96% of its value in the past seven days, and now has a smaller market value than its stablecoin counterpart.
Blue-chip tokens bitcoin and ether saw wild swings throughout the day as traders monitored UST's descent as well as hotter-than-expected April inflation data. Bitcoin was last up 1% at $31,377, having previously slumped below $30,000. Ether fell 1% to $2,309.
Stablecoins are akin to bank accounts for the crypto economy, offering a sound store of value to avoid the kind of volatility cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have become notorious for — in theory, at least.
UST is what's known as an ""algorithmic"" stablecoin. It uses a complex system of minting and burning tokens to adjust supply and stabilize prices. UST's price has crumbled under the pressure of a sell-off in cryptocurrencies recently, resulting in further panic in the market."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Marco Bello/Getty Images Marco Bello/Getty Images
As the old maxim goes, sometimes the bigger they are the harder they fall.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surged during the pandemic, turning many amateur investors into millionaires, on paper at least. Bitcoin, for example, hit an all-time of nearly $68,000 in November.
Today, it's trading at less than half that amount as part of an intense sell-off that has accelerated in recent weeks.
It's been even worse for an area of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins, in particular one called TerraUSD that has tumbled hard.
Here's a look at what's going on.
So why are cryptocurrencies down so much?
Put simply, cryptocurrencies got caught up in the maelstrom affecting broader markets.
Stocks, bonds and other assets have tumbled in recent weeks as investors fear the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates aggressively to fight inflation, raising the prospect of a recession.
The falls in broader markets have affected cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin down more than 20% in the past two weeks.
The selloff has been worse for some of the newer cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, which started as a joke and then took off, in part, thanks to the support of billionaire Elon Musk.
It's a stark reversal from a few months ago, when actors such as Matt Damon and Larry David were pitching crypto companies in Super Bowl commercials.

Wasn't Bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation?
Yes, but it hasn't turned out to be one, at least so far.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most popular of them all.
Proponents of Bitcoin had long touted the digital currency as an inflation hedge, in part because there is a finite amount of it.
But Bitcoin has tumbled hard, along with stocks.
If Bitcoin was seen as a true hedge against inflation, it should be rallying given that inflation is at its highest in decades.
""A lot of people thought it would be an inflation hedge, but there's really very little data to prove that,"" says Randy Frederick, a managing director at Charles Schwab who covers cryptocurrencies. ""Most recently, it has not moved up as the market has moved down. Had it been an inflation hedge, it might have done that.""
In fact, Bitcoin is reacting just like any other riskier asset such as stocks.
Still, the argument of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is not quite dead either, experts say.
Bitcoin may be the oldest of the cryptocurrencies, but it has only been around for just over a decade.
That means analysts don't have a lot of historical data. Frederick, for instance, says we'll know a lot more about how Bitcoin behaves through more market cycles.

What about stablecoins?
Cryptocurrencies have spawned offshoots and led to more sophisticated – or as some regulators see them, dangerous – assets.
Stablecoins such as tether or USD Coin are a type of crypto that are gaining in popularity.
Most stablecoins are meant to be backed by real assets. That means that for every dollar-worth of a stablecoin, the exchange or the seller would need to set aside the equivalent in a real fiat currency, such as the dollar, or the equivalent amount in an easy-to-trade security such as government bonds.
That's what is supposed to make them more ""stable."" If the buyer of the stablecoin wanted to cash out of that virtual currency, it should be easy since the exchange is supposed to have the money at hand, similar to how bank customers expect to be able to withdraw their money at any time.
But regulators have long questioned whether exchanges really do keep those hard assets aside in an account. Moreover, stablecoins have created their own offshoots.
One of them, TerraUSD, has run into big trouble in recent days. TerraUSD is known as an algorithmic stablecoin because it relies on financial engineering to maintain the 1-to-1 peg between the stablecoin and the backup assets.
TerraUSD is even pegged to another cryptocurrency called Luna.
The stablecoin cratered to 14 cents as of Friday, well below the $1 it should theoretically be fetching.
Pat Tschosik, a senior portfolio strategist with Ned Davis Research, says TerraUSD's troubles could be part of a potential winnowing of cryptocurrencies.
""It's still really young,"" he says, of crypto. ""You know, this is still a developing area. There is going to be speculation. There is going to be booms and busts along the way, and this is all still new.""

So where do we go from here?
More broadly, the outlook for cryptocurrencies will likely continue to be tied to broader market sentiment.
But the falls in cryptocurrencies and the collapsing value of TerraUSD stand to alarm policymakers such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler.
That may lead to more regulation of cryptocurrencies in general.
Sustained falls in cryptocurrencies could also raise doubts about the future of the virtual money more broadly, just when there had been signs that it was trying to mature, with more and more professional investors starting to trade them.
Last month, Fidelity, the largest provider of retirement plans, announced it would allow employers to offer Bitcoin in 401(k) plans, although the Department of Labor has cautioned employers against doing that.
Still, cryptocurrencies also have a lot of fanatical followers who are used to steep selloffs and reversals, and many of them believe that this is a short-term decline.
Tschosik from Ned Davis Research, for example, is ""long-term bullish on Bitcoin,"" he says. ""We still see the acceptance of it continuing to expand.""
He points to millennials, for example, who want to invest in cryptocurrencies because they seem as as a ""legitimate option.""
Not everybody agrees, however, leaving the future of cryptocurrencies uncertain."

The creator of Bitcoin (BTC), Satoshi Nakamoto, warranted the security of the BTC network through a decentralized network of BTC miners who are tasked with confirming the legitimacy of transactions and minting new blocks.
Given the extensive community support — from developers to hodlers to traders to miners — that spans over 13 years, the BTC network was witness to a historic 10-month-long rally as it achieved mining difficulty of 31.251 trillion.

Mining difficulty safeguards the BTC ecosystem against network attacks such as double-spending, wherein bad actors try to reverse confirmed transactions over the BTC blockchain. Greater mining difficulty demands higher computational power from miners to confirm transactions over the BTC network.
As a result, BTC’s latest network difficulty ATH makes it nearly impossible for bad actors to represent over 50% of the hash rate. According to blockchain.com, the BTC network demands 220.436 million terahashes/second (TH/s) at the time of writing.

Despite the crypto community’s concerns related to the ongoing targeted attacks and an active bear market, BTC continues to position itself as the most resilient blockchain network.

Roughly $1.4 billion worth of BTC was reportedly moved from a wallet tied to Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) as the community announced their intent to “proactively defend the stability of the UST peg [and] broader Terra economy.”
Terra’s ecosystem of tokens took a nosedive as the stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) depegged from its initial $1.00 value to nearly $0 in a matter of days, sparking commotion among the Terra (LUNA) and UST investors.
While Terra co-founder Do Kwon attributed the market collapse to coordinated attack against the protocol, current plans for reviving the UST and LUNA ecosystems involve purchasing and redistributing BTC based on requirements."
363,2022-05-14,2022-05-14,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Decrypt,Jeff John Roberts",decrypt.co,7 Big Moments From Bitcoin and Crypto's Craziest Week Ever,"Here are the 7 moments that defined the craziest week in crypto history, from Terra's implosion to COIN and HOOD drops to Janet Yellen's take.",https://decrypt.co/100358/7-big-moments-from-bitcoin-crypto-crash,"Where to begin? In a decade of covering crypto I've seen a lot of crazy things, but never a week like that. In the past, there have certainly been one-off incidents that turned the industry upside down—like the 2014 Mt. Gox hack, or Tesla buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, or Elon Musk shilling Dogecoin on SNL—but never a cascade of events like we just saw.
In the coming days, there will be plenty of think pieces about what caused the craziness. And just maybe there will be some earnest self-reflection as to why the crypto community tolerates the people who triggered much of the current mess in the first place. But for now, let's take a breath and take stock of just what the hell happened in crypto's craziest week ever. Here are seven key moments.
1. Terra goes up in flames: Until a week ago, Terra was the hottest thing in crypto: its governance token LUNA was a top-10 coin by market cap, and its dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin UST was the No. 4 stablecoin. And then, pop! Both went just about to zero. (LUNA is trading at a fraction of a fraction of a cent, while UST bottomed out at 13 cents.) Plenty of projects have collapsed before Terra, but never one this big and never in such spectacular fashion. The crypto world will be talking about this disaster for years to come—and autopsying why so many in the industry were so quick to put their faith in Terra's high-risk structure.
2. $200 billion of crypto value vaporized in 24 hours: That's from a Bloomberg story on Thursday, which followed earlier reports that the crypto markets had already lost more than $1 trillion before the Terra crack-up. To put this in perspective, $200 billion is more than the entire market cap of Bitcoin in 2020. If you want to put a positive spin on the carnage, you can note that much of the collapse was driven by macroeconomic forces (it's not just crypto bleeding red this month) and that the crypto market is now big enough to survive a loss of that magnitude. But still. $200 billion!
3. COIN collapse: On Thursday, Coinbase shares (COIN) bottomed out at $40.83—a 90% drop from its debut price of $381 in April of last year. This is the flagship company of the crypto industry and, unlike many tech firms, has been profitable for most of its existence. Coinbase's spiral, which had been ongoing well before this week's market meltdown, mostly reflects that Wall Street still does not know how to value crypto. (On Friday, shares began climbing back to near $70).
4. Secretary Yellen says no systemic risk: This news got buried among the market madness, but it's a big deal that the Treasury Secretary told Congress this week crypto poses no ""systemic risk"" to the broader U.S. economy. The ""systemic"" term is a technical one and would have subjected the industry to a punishing set of new regulations.
5. Tether breaks the buck: Stablecoins are supposed to be stable. This week called the whole concept into question. Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by far, briefly dipped to 95 cents before recovering. Tether has broken its peg in the past but, coming amid the Terra debacle, its latest slip was terrible timing—and will only increase scrutiny of Tether's opaque accounting practices.
6. SBF takes a piece of Robinhood: FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried revealed he has taken an 8% position in HOOD, which could presage a full takeover. If that comes to pass, it would be an ironic turn for Robinhood, which was once seen as a Silicon Valley darling and a serious rival to Coinbase. Now its growth has slowed, it's cutting 9% of its workforce, and the stock is down 70% in a year.
7. Musk says ""maybe not"" to Twitter: It wouldn't be a crazy week in crypto without some Elon antics. Sure enough, the Tesla CEO kicked off Friday by suggesting he might not buy Twitter after all; the stock reacted poorly. He later clarified he's ""still committed"" to buying Twitter, but what happens next is anyone's guess. Twitter is the industry's most important communication platform, and Musk its biggest influencer, so it all matters.
Those were just seven news moments in a week full of many more of them—including an impending default by El Salvador thanks to mismanagement by the country's Bitcoin bro president. Crypto went on its craziest rollercoaster ride yet, and my biggest takeaway is that most in the industry will be fine. WAGMI, as they say. Unless you're a Terra bagholder.

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt
A cursory glance at the Decrypt home page this week would have been enough to see that the global crypto industry is a hive of panic.
Crypto’s craziest week saw some $200 billion of total market capitalization evaporate between Wednesday and Thursday, while industry leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum crashed to lows not seen since 2020, putting institutional whales like Elon Musk and Michael Saylor back underwater. What’s more, according to analysts at Huobi, we haven’t reached the bottom.
Terra’s leading cryptocurrency LUNA—last week one of the top 10 in the world—fell to zero. LUNA posted an all-time high of $118.19 only last month, and it's now trading for a fraction of a penny.
LUNA’s demise was driven by the collapse of Terra’s other leading coin, the greenback-pegged UST, which bottomed out at 13 cents on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. It rose slightly today to 19 cents, as of this writing.
The week’s numbers
It’s now the sixth consecutive week of market decline as virtually every top 100 cryptocurrency by market capitalization starts the weekend down by double-digit percentages. Bitcoin is down 20% from last week, trading at $28,809, and Ethereum fell by 27% to $1,968.
Among the week's biggest losers: Cosmos sank 43% to $9.68, Algorand dropped 43% to $.42, NEAR Protocol fell 43% to $6.05, Polygon fell 40% to $.62, and Avalanche plummeted 48% to $29.83.
The only top 100 coin that gained this week was Maker, the 42nd biggest cryptocurrency by market cap at $1.4 billion, which rose 7.1% to $1,419.
The week’s news
Aside from Terra’s meltdown, the news cycle carried on much as the last few months, albeit with heightened talk of stablecoin regulation.
On Monday, Instagram announced it’s testing NFT connectivity with a handful of U.S.-based collectors and creators. The pilot allows testers to link crypto wallets to their accounts and display verified collectibles. Parent company Meta also said Facebook NFT support is expected soon.
Economist and former no-coiner Nouriel Roubini has begun working on an inflation-proof dollar-pegged stablecoin, according to a Bloomberg report on Monday. Roubini’s Atlas Capital has tapped Andreessen Horowitz-backed Web3 developer Mysten Labs to develop tech for the “United Sovereign Governance Gold Optimized Dollar.” The project is a total about-turn for Roubini, who in 2018 delivered a 37-page speech calling crypto the “Mother of All Scams.”
Also on Monday, Salvadoran dictator Nayyib Bukele purchased 500 BTC at around $15.3 million. This took the total number of El Salvador’s Bitcoin stash to 2,300, or around $66 million—currently $6.25 million (9%) shy of its value when Decrypt reported the purchase. In total, Bukele is $37 million in the hole today.
On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen highlighted Terra’s collapse as an example of why stablecoins need to be imminently regulated. On Thursday, Yellen mentioned crypto again, this time to say that the industry’s $1.23 trillion market cap poses no systemic risk to the U.S. financial system, and by extension, neither do stablecoins, ""but they're growing very rapidly and present the same kind of risks we’ve known for centuries from bank runs.”
Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler leveled sharp criticism at cryptocurrency exchanges and stablecoins during an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. Taking issue with the fact that many big exchanges run custody, market making, and trading services without separating them as traditional exchanges are required to, Gensler accused them of “trading against their customers often because they’re market-marking against their customers.”
That same day, Germany's federal finance ministry (BMF) issued the country’s first guidance on the income tax treatment of cryptocurrencies. Parliamentary State Secretary Katja Hessel said in a statement that the sale of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum is now tax-free for individuals after one year of owning the assets."

The CEO of CryptoQuant offered a solution to a question concerning the cryptocurrency market: will Bitcoin break below the $20,000 range or not? According to the analyst, there is a major reason why it will not unless certain groups of traders want it to drop further.
The analyst's foundation is the Finex whale, who owns at least $1.17 billion worth of BTC in open long positions. The whale has created massive support for the first cryptocurrency, which requires tremendous selling pressure to be broke, which simply will not appear without a certain group pushing the price of the cryptocurrency down.
Some say the price is going to crash below $20k.
Yeah, if Finex whale who has at least $1.17B worth of #Bitcoins get liquidated, it can go below $20k.

The only group that can provide more than $1 billion in pure liquidity is Wall Street-tier financial institutions that might be interested in purchasing the digital gold at a significant discount.
While the market previously had a large potential seller represented by the Luna Foundation Guard, which owned billions worth of BTC, the market has no sellers that might push the price of the cryptocurrency down so badly.

Previously, the LFG reported a sale of more than $2 billion worth of Bitcoin on the market. Such a large deal was most likely done via market makers and/or OTC trading desks since it would require a liquidity that no exchange can offer upon request.
With no major selling pressure remaining on the market and most large sellers gone, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should enter an accumulation phase after the massive distribution we saw in November.
At press time, BTC trades at $29,909 and is barely holding around the $30,000 support."
366,2022-05-16,2022-05-16,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Ryan Browne,www.cnbc.com,What happened to the bitcoin reserve behind Terra's UST stablecoin?,Luna Foundation Guard said it spent almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve last week in a futile attempt to save UST.,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/what-happened-to-the-bitcoin-reserve-behind-terras-ust-stablecoin.html,"Investors have been eager to find out what happened to the $3 billion in bitcoin bought up by crypto firm Terra to back its failed stablecoin. Now, they've got their answer.
Luna Foundation Guard, a fund set up by Terra creator Do Kwon, said Monday it spent almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve last week in a futile attempt to save terraUSD — or UST, for short.
The foundation had accumulated a total of more than 80,000 bitcoins, which was worth nearly $3 billion last week, as well as other tokens including BNB, tether, USDC and avalanche. Kwon had promised to use the bitcoin in the event of a dramatic fall in the value of UST.
In a series of tweets, Luna Foundation Guard said it transferred 52,189 bitcoins to ""trade with a counterparty"" as UST fell below its intended $1 peg. A further 33,206 bitcoins were sold by Terra directly in a last-ditch effort to defend the peg, the foundation said.
As of Monday, Luna Foundation Guard had just 313 bitcoins left in its reserve, worth approximately $9.3 million. The firm said it would use the remainder of its $85 million in crypto assets — including some BNB and avalanche — to ""compensate remaining users"" of UST.
""We are still debating through various distribution methods, updates to follow soon,"" Luna Foundation Guard said.
UST is what's known as an ""algorithmic"" stablecoin. Unlike tether and USDC, which hold fiat assets in a reserve to back their tokens, UST relied on a complex set of code, coupled with a floating token called luna, to balance supply and demand and stabilize the price.
When UST began to drop below $1 last week, luna also started to sell off, resulting in a vicious cycle that caused UST to plunge to less than 30 cents while luna became worthless. UST is now worth just 9 cents, according to CoinGecko data.
""The big problem when you're dealing with a partially collateralized stablecoin like UST is that your hard collateral — bitcoin, in this case — is going to be considerably more valuable to [investors] than your governance token,"" or luna, said Frances Coppola, an independent economist."

LFG reportedly has only 313 Bitcoin left, significantly down from the 80,394 it held before UST and LUNA started crashing.

The Luna Foundation Guard revealed early Monday in a tweet storm that it had sold off almost its entire Bitcoin reserve in the failed attempt to prevent the meltdown of its native governance token LUNA and flagship stablecoin UST.
LFG Says Its Bitcoin Reserves Are Gone
The Luna Foundation Guard has finally revealed what happened to its $3 billion Bitcoin reserve.
LFG, a nonprofit organization tasked with protecting the dollar peg of Terra’s UST stablecoin, reported early Monday in a tweet storm that it had spent almost all of its Bitcoin reserves in an attempt to protect UST’s peg. The foundation said that on May 7, or one day before UST began to de-peg from its targeted $1 parity, it had 80,394 Bitcoin (its largest holding worth around $3 billion at the time), along with approximately 26.2 million USDT, 23.5 million USDC, 1.9 million AVAX, 1.6 million LUNA, and 697,344 UST.
After UST began de-pegging on May 8, LFG admitted to selling all of its USDT and USDC reserves for an aggregate of 50,200,071 UST and transferred 52,189 Bitcoin to trade with a counterparty for 1,515,689,462 UST. After its actions had failed to stabilize the system, on May 10, LFG exchanged an additional 33,206 Bitcoin for 1,164,018,521 UST in a last-ditch effort to defend the stablecoin’s peg.
According to the Foundation, this left it with only 313 Bitcoin worth around $9.2 million at current prices, about $11,7 million worth of BNB, $63,29 million worth of Avalanche, and an excess of LUNA and UST tokens worth almost nothing at current prices. In total, LFG’s reserves are currently worth around $81 million, significantly down from the $4.1 billion they were worth at their height on May 3.
LFG said it was looking to use its remaining assets “to compensate remaining users of $UST,” with the smallest holders being first in line. “We are still debating through various distribution methods,” the Foundation said, announcing that updates would follow soon.
The Monday report from LFG comes after the organization came under heavy fire on Twitter for the opaqueness of how it handled its reserves, with many in the crypto community wondering where $3 billion worth of Bitcoin went during Terra’s ecosystem-wide crash.
UST, which was already trading for pennies on the dollar, has plummeted by around 15% on the news, while LUNA has dipped around 3.6% following the announcement while trading 34% down on the day.

In a Twitter thread, the team behind the failed algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and the token LUNA shared precisely how much Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto assets they had disposed of.
The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) also promised to “compensate remaining users of $UST, smallest holders first,” with the remaining assets.
In summary, 80,081 BTC, or 99.61% of the Bitcoin that LFG guarded, has exited the fund. The group confirmed the sale of “33,206 $BTC for an aggregate 1,164,018,521 $UST” in a tweet. The remaining 47,188 BTC is not accounted for, while 313 BTC remains in reserve.
Interestingly, LFG has not sold a single BNB or AVAX token, holding around 40,000 and 2,000,000 of each, respectively.
The below graphic outlines the remaining tokens in the LFG reserve:
The reason behind the disposal and sale of cryptocurrency in the LFG reserve was to support the health of the Terra ecosystem:

Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity because they allow for quick and seamless transaction payments.
With a CAGR of 7.1 percent, the global cryptocurrency market is expected to reach US$2.2 billion in 2026. Apart from Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, there are a number of other cryptos with promise.
Crypto investors should keep an eye out for other top ten cryptocurrencies with brighter futures than Bitcoin in 2022 if they want to make money in their crypto wallets.
Ethereum
Ethereum is not the same as bitcoin. Crypto has recently broken records, stabilizing its market position. Its network allows developers to use the ether network to create their own cryptocurrency.
Despite the fact that it was launched years after several other cryptocurrencies, its unique technology has allowed it to far exceed its market position. It is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies that will begin a bullish rally by the end of the year.
Cardano
Due to its flexible network and quick transactions, Cardano remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. It claims to be more environmentally friendly than other currencies. It, like stock dividends, can justify higher prices over time as it gains real-world applications, ranging from farm supply chains to preventing retail plagiarism.
Its main selling points are scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. The facility can now build smart contracts on its network thanks to a recent network upgrade.
Tether
Tether tokens, which pioneered the concept in the digital token space, are the most widely used stablecoins. Tether Tokens support and empower growing ventures and innovation across the blockchain space, acting as a disruptor to the traditional financial system and a trailblazer in the digital use of traditional currencies. Tether Tokens are digital tokens that are built on a variety of blockchains.
Dogecoin
DOGE rose to prominence after months of criticism for being nothing more than a meme coin, thanks to Elon Musk's moniker as the ""Dodgemaster."" Nobody expected this coin to gain legitimacy and become a long-term investment for other cryptocurrency traders.
DOGE has gained popularity this year and is one of the most cost-effective cryptos available. Dogecoin is being considered by several crypto analysts as a viable investment option.
Stellar
Stellar is another open-source project that allows its users to create, send, and trade all types of digital money. It is a large-scale project that claims to be capable of supporting all of the world's financial institutions. The XLM network is kept in sync across devices thanks to blockchain technology.

In Pennsylvania, Big Dog Energy LLC has installed 30 gas-fired generators at one of its gas well pads in Beccaria Township, using the electricity they produce in an ingenious, profitable, and possibly environmentally-damaging pursuit—mining the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin.
After the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection discovered the mining operation on a January site visit, it sent the company a notice of violation that alleged the firm had installed and operated generators without authorization. Per the letter to owner Matthew Anderson, these operations violate sections of the state environmental code, which prohibits the construction or modification of an air contamination source without a permit.
Big Dog Energy also started mining bitcoin at a site in Woodward Township, and submitted notices of intent to develop gas wells in Covington and Gulich townships as well, according to reporting by Mikayla Heiss, a local journalist. It remains to be seen if the wells in Covington and Gulich would also be used to mine bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency in which every transaction is recorded in a distributed digital ledger, with each block of transactions added to a long chain of transactions, or the blockchain. In exchange for verifying a block, which involves racing to solve complex cryptographic puzzles, so-called miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrencies’ value to society is hotly contested. Proponents say they give owners privacy and freedom from control of governments and banks, and the opportunity to reap big profits as the value of the private currency rises. Opponents claim cryptocurrencies are used to hide illegal wealth and activities, and are at their core giant Ponzi schemes, in which an essentially worthless good increases in price only so long as new customers buy into it. The recent volatility in cryptocurrency markets has only accentuated that controversy.
Beyond the conceptual questions about cryptocurrency, the process of creating new bitcoin—the metaphorical mining, even though it consists entirely of computer transactions—is energy-intensive, prompting questions about its environmental impact. The more computer power a miner can devote to mining, the more bitcoin he or she can mint. The cheaper the electricity cost, the greater the profits. And if the electricity is generated via fossil fuels, those profits come with increased emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, fueling climate change.
Over the past few years, bitcoin miners have found novel ways to acquire cheap electricity—including buying their own power plants. Other miners have begun purchasing gas that otherwise would have been flared off at oil wells in places like Texas and North Dakota to power on-site generators, using the electricity to mine bitcoin in server farms set up in shipping containers. At least in those cases, the gas would have been burned no matter what, so there are no additional greenhouse gas emissions.
The same can’t be said of Big Dog Energy’s operations, or of other off-grid mining operations at stranded gas wells. These are wells that have been opened and fracked but aren’t connected to pipelines, so well owners have no way to bring the gas to market. Anyone who sets up a bitcoin mining operation at one of these stranded sites is burning fossil fuels that would have stayed in the ground, if not for bitcoin.
Rob Altenburg, the director of the Energy Center at Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, a statewide environmental advocacy group, said miners who own gas wells can make more than twice as much money using their gas to mine bitcoin than they could selling it to the wholesale market. Altenburg is concerned about what this means for air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Pennsylvania, especially if more gas companies follow Big Dog’s lead. And since these operations are relatively mobile, they are hard to monitor and regulate.
“They take the generators on trailers and plug them into their gas well, run the generators and mine bitcoin,” Altenburg said. “And the problem with these is, they’re on wheels, and they didn’t apply for a permit. They just showed up one day with the trailers and plugged them in.”
Altenburg points out that Big Dog Energy owns other wells in the state where they could have started mining without anyone noticing. “I think it’s a fair question of, has anybody gone and looked at those other wells?” Altenburg said. “And has anybody looked at other companies?”
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection did not respond to emailed questions about Big Dog Energy’s bitcoin mining operations. Owner Matt Anderson told the local paper that the notice of violations “are likely inapplicable to my operations.”
“They seem to be at least trying to claim that they don’t even need a permit,” Altenburg said. “They’re either seeming to claim that they’re part of their existing permit for the gas wells—which I don’t believe and the people I’ve talked to at DEP don’t believe that. But, you know, courts haven’t weighed in on this yet, this is brand new. Or they’re claiming that they’re somehow exempted because of the nature of these sources, whether they’re too small, or they’re mobile.”
Another energy company in Pennsylvania is selling electricity produced at a gas well pad in Ridgway Township to power a bitcoin mining operation. In a statement provided to local journalist Brian Stockman, the company said, “Pin Oak Energy is evaluating what is being called a ‘digital pipeline.’ In essence, this process converts on-site natural gas production to on-site electricity to be used in a variety of applications.”
There are over a thousand unconventional (that is, fracked) wells in Pennsylvania that have been drilled but never reported any gas, condensate, or oil production through 2021, according to FracTracker Alliance. It’s not hard to imagine the owners of those stranded assets bringing in generators and bitcoin miners to get the profits flowing, especially if it is deemed to be legal.
Pennsylvania isn’t the only place this is happening. In 2020, a bitcoin mining company called Link Global installed four 1.25 megawatt gas generators at a dormant natural gas well in Alberta, Canada, and started mining bitcoin. The generators ran for nearly a year (364 days) without permission. Another unauthorized bitcoin mining operation by the same company ran for over 400 days.
In South Dakota, a bitcoin mining company called Highwire Energy purchased the mineral rights to seven natural gas wells that had been slated to be plugged.
Avi Asher-Schapiro, a reporter with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, interviewed someone who goes by “Hodl Tarantula” who mines bitcoin at abandoned gas wells in southeast Kentucky. Tarantula told Asher-Shapiro that just one site was bringing in $20,000 worth of bitcoin a month. Tarantula explained his operations in more detail on the Fun with Bitcoin podcast last year. Depending on the volume of gas available at each site, Tarantula said he will install a 1/2 megawatt or 1 megawatt generator to power the miners.
While the electricity generation may be small at individual sites, it could quickly add up depending on how fast Tarantula and other off-grid miners scale. “There is no limit to the amount of capital that can be extracted from stranded energy now that bitcoin mining is at play,” Tarantula told Asher-Schapiro.
On the podcast, Tarantula claimed that mining at stranded gas wells is environmentally friendly. “We’re reducing fugitive emissions, which is natural gas that would leak out, we’re actually putting it through a controlled environment and combusting it to CO2 which can be used by trees and turned into oxygen, which we breathe,” he said. “Whereas the methane or the CH4 that leaks out is 30 percent more damaging to the atmosphere and the ozone and there’s absolutely nothing that converts that into something that can be used in a beneficial manner by humanity.”
Properly plugging gas wells reduces methane emissions without increasing carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to global warming and climate change.
Tarantula is also part of the cottage industry that has sprung up to supply people with stranded gas resources with turnkey bitcoin mining solutions. Per his Twitter bio, he is now director of mining at a company based in Wyoming called Sovereign Mining, which sells pre-manufactured Bitcoin mining facilities with the enthusiastic tagline, “Mine Bitcoin Anywhere!” The company says it is “committed to powering the Bitcoin network with stranded and under utilized energy.”
Tarantula is (or at least was) also affiliated with a Kentucky-based gas company called Midstream, which sells turnkey solutions to prospective miners in addition to mining bitcoin. Per the company’s website, “instead of selling our gas, we use it to fuel generators which in turn power our cryptocurrency mining machines. Through this strategy, we are able to extract 10x more value from our natural gas.” It’s a good selling point for what the company calls the Big Rig, a 300-kilowatt mining array designed “for natural gas producers who want to dip their toes into mining powered by their own gas.”
Marshall Holbrook, the chief operating officer at Midstream, is also the chief executive officer of Puissant Industries Inc, a “natural gas development and cryptocurrency mining” company that owns 39 wells in eastern Kentucky.
In Kentucky, at least, off-grid mining appears to be perfectly legal. “We are aware of at least some working off previously idle gas wells, but there are no oil and gas statutes that prevent or govern this activity, beyond normal well maintenance, safety, and reporting requirements,” John Mura, a communications director at the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, wrote in an email. Mura added that he was “still checking on the permitting requirement for generators used in this manner.”
It is difficult to assess the scale at which bitcoin mining is bringing stranded gas wells online, because these operations are, as Altenburg observed, relatively small and mobile. They may only come to light—as in Alberta, and as in Ridgway, Pennsylvania—because residents complain about the noise. Even once people find out about them, local and state government officials may not be able to tell miners to stop.
“It’s really difficult for a state environmental regulator to deny permits,” Altenburg said. “I spent 22 years working for DEP. And I had to tell a lot of people that if a company meets the permit criteria, and DEP denies the permit—DEP doesn’t get to say, ‘We’re not going to let you do this, because we think it’s a bad idea.’ They’ve got to say, you know, ‘Do you meet these criteria or not?’ And the criteria were not written in a world where bitcoin mining was even a thought.”"
372,2022-05-17,2022-05-17,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Peter Howson,theconversation.com,Cryptocurrency price collapse offers hope for slowing climate change,Bitcoin has lost over half of its value since November 2021.,https://theconversation.com/cryptocurrency-price-collapse-offers-hope-for-slowing-climate-change-heres-how-183143,"Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were meant to be used as digital cash. Instead, they’ve become popular as speculative investments. As well as being resource-intensive and inherently wasteful, cryptocurrencies are also incredibly volatile. Prices for the largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, have both dropped by over 55% in six months, leading some to suggest that regulation is needed to contain the turmoil.
Some are blaming sliding prices on one specific contagion, a collapsing “stablecoin” called TerraUSD which is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar. But the current cryptocurrency market crash is more likely a combination of lots of factors.

For years, interest rates have been close to zero, making bank bonds and treasury bills look boring as investments, while cryptocurrencies and digital non-fungible tokens (or NFTs) linked to artwork, look appealing. However, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England recently increased interest rates by the largest amount since 2000.
Continuing COVID controls and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have also sobered up the markets. Bitcoin was designed to be indifferent towards governments and banks, but investors generally aren’t. They’re cutting sources of risk from their portfolios and dumping crypto.
Crypto’s loss, climate’s gain?
Bitcoin (a “proof-of-work” cryptocurrency) uses roughly 118.47 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity over a year – more than all the domestic refrigerators in the US combined.
Proof-of-work mining can be thought of as a controlled way of wasting energy. The process involves specialist computers repeatedly taking random shots at guessing a long string of digits. The amount of computing power dedicated to this effort is referred to as the network’s hash rate.
If the hash rate drops for any reason, because of power cuts or price dips, for example, the difficulty of the guessing game is automatically adjusted to ensure the network can find a new winner every ten minutes. Each winner then gets a go at verifying transactions occurring on the network and is awarded 6.25 newly minted bitcoins.
Whether the guessing game is profitable or not depends on how much the mining outfit has paid to set up their computers and for the energy to run them. Recent research indicates that when China cracked down on bitcoin mining in August 2021, bitcoin’s carbon intensity increased by around 17%, with only 25% of bitcoin miners using renewable energy and over 60% relying on coal and natural gas. Estimates vary, however. A survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council (an industry body) of roughly half of all miners in the first quarter of 2022 claimed total renewable energy use (including nuclear) was 58%.
The higher the cryptocurrency price, the more cash mining outfits are prepared to waste on this electricity, until the costs of winning outweigh the rewards. With the bitcoin price falling, the financial incentive to waste energy for mining bitcoin should be lower. In theory, that’s good for the climate. But, surprisingly, the network’s hash rate (and carbon footprint) remains very close to its all-time high, averaging around 200 quintillion hashes per second. The scale of this continued interest means bitcoin mining at current prices is probably still profitable. But for how long?
Tipping points and death spirals
Bitcoin’s value has temporarily dropped below the estimated cost of production several times before without significant long-term damage to the hash rate. But should the market stagnate for long enough, proof-of-work cryptocurrencies will start to see an increasing number of miners capitulate.
Miners with the highest costs are likely to sell off their bitcoin holdings as profitability drops, creating even more selling pressure in the market. Short-term capitulation among smaller mining outfits with high costs (often using intermittent renewable energy) is normal.
But a domino effect with major mining firms closing down one after another could cause crypto prices, and the network’s carbon emissions, to drop rapidly towards zero. This event is called a bitcoin death spiral in crypto-speak.
Besides bitcoin mining price predicaments, there are other potential tipping points to consider. Many big investors, especially those who bought in at higher prices, are currently underwater – weighed down with big bags of bitcoin.
El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has reportedly just brought his country’s total reserve of bitcoin up to around 2,300, or about US$72 million at current prices. His country’s crypto losses are adding to fears of an imminent debt default that would cause significant pain to those who had no say in their leader’s gamble.
Bitcoin ban or boycott
Mining outfits and crypto developers have taken advantage of economic instability, weak regulations and access to cheap energy in the past. Locals wanting to use these resources for productive purposes can be priced out by bitcoin miners. These communities also tend to face the sharp end of the climate crisis, which crypto mining fuels.
Governments worldwide want to appear keen on cryptocurrencies as tools for economic growth. But the crash shows that bitcoin is both useless as a mainstream means of exchange and as a reliable store of value.
In the aftermath of the 2008-10 global financial crisis, governments promised a crackdown on toxic financial instruments with make-believe valuations. For the global climate and a stable economy, cracking down now on crypto is a good idea. But if environmental regulation efforts are not globally coordinated or far-reaching enough, crypto’s climate contagion could continue to grow.

$20,000 retest ‘highly unlikely’
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD climbing after the daily close to tentatively build on $30,000.
Still, in a multi-day range, the pair was yet to decide on a meaningful upward or downward trajectory, while volatility ebbed into the new week.
Amid concerns that a major retracement could take it below last week’s ten-month lows, popular analyst Credible Crypto offered a more optimistic alternative. Based on historical norms, he argued on Twitter, thatBitcoin had little impetus to retest $20,000 or lower.
“The argument for 13K-14K $BTC on the premise that past major bear markets have led to 80% declines from the top makes a major assumption- that 65k was the cycle top,” he wrote.
“It’s the same assumption people made at 30k in June ‘21 before we rallied to a new ATH of 65K 3 months later.”
As Cointelegraph recently reported, contingency plans appear to be in place already for such an event, with MicroStrategy — the company with the largest corporate BTC treasury — even prepared to buy up supply to stem the fall.
Asked whether BTC/USD could repeat the retracement from its 2019 highs near $14,000 to the $3,600 floor during the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, Credible Crypto was just as skeptical.
“Not expecting that. Is it possible? Yes, but as I’ve said previously a retest of prior cycle highs has never happened before- so I find it highly unlikely,” he responded.
For Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, it was a question of the United States dollar cooling its bull run versus other fiat currencies in order to give risk assets some breathing space.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY), he forecasted, should come down from its twenty-year highs of 105 points.

“If I look at the current state of the $DXY, I think we’ll follow through with this scenario. Assuming we’ll be seeing some corrective move, the highs have been swept for liquidity. Losing 103.7 points and I think we’ll get more downwards pressure here -> risk-on assets up,” he tweeted on May 16.
Sentiment echoes March 2020 aftermath
Market sentiment data meanwhile reflected the majority consensus across crypto — that anything could now happen, with bias firmly skewed to the downside.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a cross-market sentiment gauge, hit 8/100 on May 17, its lowest value since March 28, 2020 — two weeks after the Coronavirus lockdown-induced meltdown.
Then, as now, BTC/USD was already recovering from its lows. At $30,500, the pair was up 28% from the week prior.

Bitcoin’s recent selloff has taken the cryptocurrency closer to its May levels. This has raised concerns about how low bitcoin can go, with some analysts anticipating $20,000 levels.
Bitcoin has lost roughly 7% this week, and on Wednesday was trading at around $30,200. According to some analysts, further weakness in the cryptocurrency might lead to a drop to $20,000.
Bitcoin has been extremely volatile recently, surging and falling dramatically in response to a variety of news items. But it isn’t the only cryptocurrency to have experienced recent volatility.
The war in Ukraine, inflationary fears, and higher interest rates have all contributed to a drop in global stock markets, making it more expensive for firms to borrow money. This, paired with concerns about future regulation, has spilled over into the bitcoin market.
China’s continuing crackdown on cryptocurrency is also a factor. There has also been talk that crypto operations in Russia may come to a halt.
Furthermore, major cryptocurrencies have experienced unexpected and significant sell-offs. As consumer now lacks confidence, this has caused panic and subsequent sell-offs.

Will the price of Bitcoin rise if the stock market falls
Certainly not. Bitcoin supporters perceive it as a portfolio diversifier, yet it performed no better than stocks at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak. This is due to panic selling by investors.
Bitcoin fell by more than 40% in the first two weeks of March 2020.
“All equity markets took an aggressive leg down due of concerns over Covid-19 at that time,” says Rosie Bullard, partner and portfolio manager at James Hambro & Partners. “In an equity market reversal, it wasn’t exactly a store of value.”
However, how crypto assets perform during stock market crashes will be determined by the reason for the crash.
Most bitcoin investors believe it would safeguard them against an inflationary shock like the one that occurred in 1974.
Why the Stock market and Bitcoin keeps crashing
The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq are now well below where they were at the start of the year, down 16 percent, 12 percent, and 26 percent, respectively, as of market open on Wednesday. Last week, the Dow and Nasdaq saw their worst single-day declines since 2020. This week, the S&P 500 hit its lowest level in a year. Many names big and small in the tech sector, in particular, have been struggling.
There is no single explanation for why markets behave the way they do, why equities rise and fall, or why investor mood shifts from day to day. With that in mind, perhaps the best explanation for what’s happening right now is that there are numerous reasons for investors to be concerned, and so they are.
Inflation is an issue in the United States and around the world, with the United States’ inflation rate nearing 40-year highs. The Consumer Price Index, which measures how much people pay for goods and services, rose 8.3 percent year over year in April and 0.3 percent month over month. To battle inflation and bring prices back under control, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest rates and will soon begin to shrink its balance sheet. These steps are required, but they make Wall Street uneasy.
“The good news is that it always works. “The bad news is that it always works because it causes a recession,” said Colas.
Will Bitcoin ever go back up
Coming off its all-time high in November, a $100,000 Bitcoin price was easy to forecast late last year. With Bitcoin’s steep decline since then, the prediction game has become much more difficult.
The most ardent crypto doubters anticipate that Bitcoin will crash to $10,000 by 2022, but a middle ground could be that Bitcoin can still reach $100,000, as many experts projected late last year — albeit on a slower schedule.

According to Bloomberg's analysts, the flagship cryptocurrency may well plummet further, despite the recent rebound of 15% from the lows it crashed to last week. BTC now looks more vulnerable than before.
These signs indicate further price fall is likely
According to the article, the recent bounce of Bitcoin has led to a ""saucer-top"" pattern forming on an hourly BTC chart. Inside it, a Head and Shoulders pattern has become active, which signifies a reverse from a bullish to bearish trend.
The pattern has been activated after BTC dropped back under the neckline of the formation.
Now, in order to avoid the risk of a further downfall, the Bitcoin price needs to rise above the $30,800 level.

Musk blasts ESG “scam” after S&P 500 exit
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD circling $29,000 at the time of writing, having bounced at $28,600 on Bitstamp.
The pair had declined in step with United States equities, with the S&P 500 particularly in focus as it set its largest intraday decline since June 2020.
Drama over Tesla, which was removed from the S&P 500’s ESG Index amid ongoing controversy, fuelled the poor performance.
The firm’s CEO, Elon Musk, publicly rebuked those behind the decision, which appeared tied to adherence to so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.
“ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors,” part of a Twitter response read.

Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of investment giant Ark Invest, called the decision to exclude Tesla “ridiculous” and “not worthy of any other response.”
As counter-inflation measures begin to bite, the outlook for risk assets was at best one of “consolidation” in the months ahead, some argued.
Popular trading account CredibleCrypto agreed that Bitcoin was copying behavior exhibited by the S&P 500 during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

While bond markets could notionally benefit from financial tightening by central banks worldwide, little faith remained in their investment premise among pro-Bitcoin sources.

“It’s going to get crazier,” he added on the day.
Outside crypto, as Cointelegraph recently reported, markets commentator Holger Zschaepitz frequently refers to the situation as the “biggest bond bubble in 800 years.”

Gates explained that bitcoin provides no valuable output and therefore does not add to society.
We need to change the lens through which we define value and output to correct this misunderstanding.
Bill Gates, fourth-richest person in the world and legendary founder of Microsoft, held an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit, which was proven to be true on Twitter, where he explained he does not invest in bitcoin because it is not “adding to society”. Is he wrong?
When a Reddit user asked Gates what he thought about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he replied:
“I don't own any. I like investing in things that have valuable output. The value of companies is based on how they make great products. The value of crypto is just what some other person decides someone else will pay for it, so not adding to society like other investments.”
However, in an interview with Bloomberg this past February, Gates commented on his foundation’s opinion towards forms of digital money, when he explained:
“It’s not got the visibility of bitcoin, but the move towards digital money, that we are very engaged in, is a super positive thing that eventually will get to even the poorest countries.”
The issue is not the technological innovation of bitcoin as a digital form of money or its ability to help poor countries, because Gates clearly supports that. The issue is how Gates defines value.
Initial stock offerings create a direct interaction where investors give companies money to accomplish their goals for a share in the company. The same can be said for the bond market, where investors are giving money to governments so they can accomplish a goal, and the government agrees to pay investors back a specific amount of money for the loan.
Gates defines value by the output that is achieved by a central entity receiving money to further their own goals. This is the antithesis of bitcoin, so of course Gates opposes it.
Bitcoin is a decentralized form of currency that functions as a store of value and medium of exchange, something to be traded for something else the user wants. There is not a company you are investing in when you acquire bitcoin, therefore the output Gates uses to determine value does not exist.
Not being able to invest in bitcoin is similar to how one does not invest in cash. One simply holds cash as a means to acquire other goods. The difference between cash and bitcoin is there’s no central entity controlling it, manipulating its supply, or hindering one’s ability to use it as intended by the user.
In order for Gates to accurately value bitcoin, he must first separate bitcoin from the ideology of benefitting the output of a centralized entity."

Why is El Salvador linked with Bitcoin?
Since Nayib Bukele took control of El Salvador, the country in Central America began betting on Bitcoin.
Bukele, a populist in power, is a vocal cheerleader for Bitcoin. He adopted cryptocurrency as a legal tender.
His initial plan was to turn El Salvador into a mining hub, and the first sovereign nation linked to Bitcoin.
Nevertheless, Bukele failed. Several cryptocurrency experts believe that if Bukele keeps pushing the Bitcoin project, El Salvador will be a disaster.
""The government's financial problems are not because of bitcoin, but they have gotten worse because of bitcoin,"" said Ricardo Castaneda, senior economist and country coordinator for El Salvador and Honduras at think tank Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies
""Bitcoin ceased to be a solution and has become part of the problem.""
Bitcoin fell to 45 cents since El Salvador adopted the cryptocurrency.
According to CoinMarketCap, the value of all combined cryptocurrencies fell to $1.2 trillion in November.
Citizens of El Salvador don't adopt Bitcoin as the main currency. People prefer traditional financial movements to use a complex mechanism.
Rating agencies also believe that the adoption of Bitcoin will facilitate money laundering.
Investing in Bitcoin could be negatively drastic because of the volatility of Bitcoin.
Experts don't believe pushing crypto investments will give you returns. On the contrary, it is a long-term investment, and they don't recommend putting high stakes at risk.
The US Dollar is more stable than any cryptocurrency on the market.
Lately, Bukele is seeking illegal re-election. That could cause another red flag to El Salvador, and cause a social problem."

In the crypto world, altcoin stands for alternative coins and is simply a term used for any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin.",https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/what-are-altcoins-what-investors-need-to-know/,"What Is an altcoin?
In the crypto world, altcoin stands for alternative coins and is simply a term used for any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin. So, that makes Ethereum, the cryptocurrency with the second largest market cap an altcoin as much as the 3,000 ranked cryptocurrency.
Altcoins are not required to be different from bitcoin as each altcoin will have its preferred consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-stake or proof-of-work. For example, bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency and uses the original validator method of proof-of-work, which is used by many altcoins today. Proof of work is resource-intensive and time-consuming, pushing more investors towards proof of stake coins, allowing them to contribute to the blockchain.
However, altcoins do try to differentiate themselves from bitcoin through new technology like smart contracts, PoS, or different tokenomics. Some aspects between altcoins and bitcoin will always stay the same, such as peer-to-peer systems, which are embedded into the philosophy of cryptocurrency.
Relationship between Bitcoin and Altcoins
Since the beginning of cryptocurrency, with bitcoin as the spearhead, the market has generally revolved around the price of bitcoin, with altcoins following its pumps and dips. Altcoins often come from bitcoin, tending to follow bitcoins' overall trends. Some of this matching can be put down to investors using bitcoin as a major market indicator, but some altcoin graphs are similar to bitcoins that it becomes hard to ignore.
However, as bitcoin dominance steadily decreases and more of the crypto market cap is eaten up by bitcoin, we start to see more independently priced altcoins, not exactly following bitcoins trajectory. We can put this phenomenon down to two major factors:
Investors are slowly plowing more capital into new projects with huge potential. Often large ecosystems such as DOT. The overall amount of cryptocurrencies being created is ever increasing.
Are All Altcoins Made Equal?
Simply put, no. The term altcoin encompasses a massive group of coins, all providing different utility to the crypto sphere, the term is used to differentiate them from bitcoin.
Cryptocurrency is still a very new asset class, so each cryptocurrency project has its own coin which investors buy into and often use inside of the ecosystem. For example, HIVE is used to navigate the platform. Later down the line, we should expect major altcoins to take over as the main coin used over multiple projects, as there is simply too much volatility for so many different altcoins to be viably used in the future.
The Different Types of Altcoins
Remember: Altcoins can be part of several categories at once.
Stable Coins
Stablecoins have come into existence to try and counteract the extreme volatility that the crypto market faces. Investors can hold some value in stable cryptocurrency, without having to convert it into fiat, while waiting for the next investment opportunity, or the perfect entry.
ADVERTISEMENT
Examples of altcoins would be USDT (Tethered to the US dollar, or USDC). Stablecoins are pegged to the value of a fiat currency or other more stable commodities such as gold to help hold their value.
Also, stable coins help investors get money into exchanges, without having to instantly buy a more traditional cryptocurrency.
Utility Tokens
Utility tokens act as a way of payment for services or to participate in an ecosystem. Each ecosystem will usually have its own unique utility token that is not mineable.
A well-known example of a utility token is Filecoin, used to provide storage to other blockchains. The most famous example is Ethereum.
Meme Coins
A type of stable coin fresh in the mind of most crypto investors, meme coins are described by the name, memes. Examples would be dodge coin or the recent speculation on SHIB, based on Elon Musk’s dog.
Typical attributes of a meme coin include a rapid surge in price over a short period of time, lack of utility, and often shilled and advertised by crypto influencers or celebrities on platforms such as Twitter.
Meme coins have become rife with scams once people saw the massive potential that comes from playing with investors' FOMO.
Security Tokens
Security tokens are the closest cryptocurrency comes to traditional stocks and shares. Those buying security tokens will have ‘shares’ in a company that participates or does business on a blockchain.
Security tokens help to validate ownership of a certain asset, providing greater security than before to owners and their assets. However, when a user owns their own ‘keys’ they are at risk of permanently losing access to the asset, as no centralized body can help them regain it.
Mining-Based vs Pre-mined
Altcoins which are mining based use PoW (Proof of Work) as a way to generate new coins, the method that bitcoin uses. As mentioned before this is resource-intensive and many altcoins are moving over to a PoS model, allowing users to participate in the blockchain themselves.
The alternative is to have a project with pre-mined coins, which requires initial capital to get off the ground. Coins are usually distributed during an ICO, or initial coin offering, where investors pay Bitcoin, Ethereum, or fiat for a pre-arranged amount of the essentially worthless coin. ICOs are naturally risky as there is no guarantee these coins will ever be worth anything, having never been traded before.
XPR is a massive example of a successful pre-mined coin, firmly sitting in the top 10 coins by market cap.
Do Any Altcoins Stack Up to Bitcoin
Currently, bitcoin has a market dominance hovering around 40%, with Ethereum second just under 20%. For an altcoin to ever flip bitcoin, we would need to see an already prominent coin such as Ethereum really explode in the coming years.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and will always be in the hearts of crypto investors as the unbreakable, decentralized, permissionless blockchain, an example for all future altcoins to follow.
Will Any Altcoin Ever Flip Bitcoin?
Many experts suggest that Ethereum is capable of flipping bitcoin, but will rely on a successful Ethereum 2.0 release, executing the promises that were made about faster transactions and cheaper transaction fees (Gas Fees).
However, to successfully flip Bitcoin or even Ethereum, the coin must defeat the problem of scalability, making it accessible to billions, such as Cardano.
Bitcoin has had an early bird advantage over all other cryptocurrencies, so only time will tell if an altcoin topples the Satoshi Tower.
Why Altcoins Are Important
Obviously, Bitcoin does not provide a solution to every problem trying to be solved by cryptocurrencies, so Altcoins are a necessity to solve the shortcomings of Bitcoin and provide actual utility across thousands of different sectors and markets. A task that no singular coin could finish.
Altcoins are absolutely essential for this stage in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing investors with a massive choice of projects to invest in and allowing different projects to show off their potential utility and use-cases while we grow in the adoption phase.
Time will slowly weed out useless altcoins as cryptocurrency becomes more heavily adopted and the strongest altcoins will emerge and most likely become staples as utility tokens across many ecosystems.
The Dangers of Altcoins
Altcoins encompass almost all cryptocurrencies in the market, meaning as much as they are a necessity, many come with their flaws, or are suffering from a volatile market. Here are the main dangers presented by altcoin investing and what you should look out for:
The cryptocurrency market is driven around sentiment:
Market sentiment is arguably the most powerful indicator in the cryptocurrency markets as massive bearish or bullish swings are common. Volatile cryptocurrencies are the most dangerous to hold during a bearish sentiment, as there are zero guarantees they will even recover 50% of their original price, especially if real-world utility is low, such as meme coins.
The Crypto Market Does Not Follow Economic Principles
Just because an altcoin has utility, does not mean the price will reflect it. We are still too early for mass adoption, meaning most utility speak is around the potential utility, making the cryptocurrency vulnerable to a massive drop in value.
Low Market-cap altcoins are even more volatile
Many altcoins operate on extremely low market caps, possibly trapping an investor's liquidity forever as trades are rare.
Anyone can make an altcoin
Do not get fooled by the term altcoin, any coin that is not Bitcoin is an altcoin, even meme coins made by anyone with absolutely zero value.
What Does the Future Hold for Altcoins
The honest truth that most altcoin investors do not want to hear is: that most, almost all altcoins, will not survive the next ten years. To see this as evidence, we only must look back a few years at the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap and see which ones are still there. Many projects have simply vanished out of existence, which will happen for our current set of altcoins now, only the strongest will survive.
Most analysts predict a consolidation around the top ten, fifty, or whatever the optimal amount of strong altcoins are needed for their utility and real-world use cases.
Conclusion
Altcoins will always be around and only time will tell which ones survive. The most practical advice one can give on altcoins is to simply look for projects which you see surviving past the adoption phase, based purely on speculation, and assess the future utility that is possible, and what real-world problems they are trying to solve."

Their failures have devastated some traders, though not the investment firms that cashed out early.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/18/technology/terra-luna-cryptocurrency-do-kwon.html,"Mr. Shin and Mr. Kwon began marketing the Luna currency in 2018. In 2020, Terraform started offering TerraUSD, which is known as a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency designed to serve as a reliable means of exchange. Stablecoins are typically pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar and are not supposed to fluctuate in value like other cryptocurrencies. Traders often use stablecoins to buy and sell other riskier assets.
But TerraUSD was risky even by the standards of experimental crypto technology. Unlike the popular stablecoin Tether, it was not backed by cash, treasuries or other traditional assets. Instead, it derived its supposed stability from algorithms that linked its value to Luna. Mr. Kwon used the two related coins as the basis for more elaborate borrowing and lending projects in the murky world of decentralized finance, or DeFi.
From the beginning, crypto experts were skeptical that an algorithm would keep Mr. Kwon’s twin cryptocurrencies stable. In 2018, a white paper outlining the stablecoin proposal reached the desk of Cyrus Younessi, an analyst for the crypto investment firm Scalar Capital. Mr. Younessi sent a note to his boss, explaining that the project could enter a “death spiral” in which a crash in Luna’s price would bring the stablecoin down with it.
“I was like, ‘This is crazy,’” he said in an interview. “This obviously doesn’t work.”
As Luna caught on, the naysayers grew louder. Charles Cascarilla, a founder of Paxos, a blockchain company that offers a competing stablecoin, cast doubt on Luna’s underlying technology in an interview last year. (Mr. Kwon responded by taunting him on Twitter: “Wtf is Paxos.”) Kevin Zhou, a hedge fund manager, repeatedly predicted that the two currencies would crash.
But venture investment came pouring in anyway to fund projects built on Luna’s underlying technology, like services for people to exchange cryptocurrencies or borrow and lend TerraUSD. Investors including Arrington Capital and Coinbase Ventures shoveled in more than $200 million between 2018 and 2021, according to PitchBook, which tracks funding."

It was only an experiment between cypherpunks & cryptographers without any market value or any real world applications.
On May 18, 2010 – after 14 months from Bitcoin genesis block – a computer programmer, Laszlo Hanyecz, posted at bitcointalk.org that he was willing to buy two pizzas for a price of 10,000 bitcoins.
He wanted two large ones, because he liked the idea of having leftover pizza, and warned that he didn’t want “weird fish toppings or anything like that”.
At the time, 10,000 bitcoins were roughly calculated to be around $41. There were not many people who accepted or were interested in Laszlo’s proposal in the first few days.
But on the fourth day, May 22, another forum member, then 19-year-old Jeremy Sturdivant from California, took him up on the deal and had two Papa John’s pizzas delivered to Laszlo in Florida.
This date has become known as Bitcoin Pizza Day and the value of those pizzas now is $298,175,464!
Bitcoin Pizza Day is not about the man who gave away (what is now) millions of dollars worth of bitcoin for a couple of pizzas.
It’s much more than that.
This was the first time bitcoin was used as a medium of exchange, one of the key roles of money, and used in a real world application with its intended creation 0 peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary.
Bitcoin Pizza Day played a key role in the evolution of bitcoin and showcased to the world how messy the price discovery of new tokens can be early on in its life cycle.
Hanyecz, who wrote the first GPU miner, ended up handing over around 100,000 bitcoins that American summer to people who bought him lunch.
And here is his original post from bitcointalk.org.
As for Sturdivant, no, he’s not a 30-something multi-millionaire these days. Not long after the deal, he spent the bitcoin while travelling around the US on holiday with his girlfriend.
As he told the UK Telegraph a few years ago: “If I had treated it (the bitcoin) as an investment, I might have held on a bit longer.”"
385,2022-05-21,2022-05-21,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Alin Patularu,bitcoinmagazine.com,"Bitcoin Pizza Day, A Day Of Celebration",Bitcoin Pizza Day is a time to get together with friends and family to remember the day that marked the first time bitcoin had a market value.,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-pizza-day-a-day-of-celebration,"“Pizza For Bitcoins?”
That is the title of a post from a user named “laszlo” dated May 18, 2010, on the obscure forum in a dimly-lit corner of the internet, bitcointalk.org. The request was straightforward enough, “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas. Like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.”
A user named “ender_x” commented on the thread later that day saying he thought 10,000 bitcoin was “quite a bit” for two large pizzas and wished him good luck on his journey to acquire “free pizza.” As it turns out, laszlo didn’t need luck, and neither would those pizzas be considered “free.” Five days later, on May 22, 2010, at 7:17 p.m., he commented on his own post with a picture of his pizzas saying, “I just wanted to report that I traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.” And with that, laszlo (full name: Laszlo Hanyecz) documented the first physical good purchased with bitcoin. There is even a plaque commemorating the purchase at the Papa John’s in Jacksonville, Florida, that reads, “Papa John’s. Makers of the famous Bitcoin Pizzas. May 22, 2010.”
To say Hanyecz loved pizza, would be an understatement. After this successful exchange, he posted that 10,000 bitcoin for two large pizzas was “an open offer.” Evidently many more people ordered pizza for him because on August 4, 2010, Hanyecz rescinded his offer citing that he couldn’t afford to keep generating enough bitcoin to pay for the pizzas.
Many months later, on November 29, 2010, in an eerily prophetic fashion, another user named “ribuck” posted on the thread saying, “Will this eventually become the world’s first million-dollar pizza?” As history would play out, ribuck’s prediction would prove to be far too low. It’s fair to say that no one in that forum could have predicted or anticipated just how valuable those bitcoin would become.
Since that forum thread, bitcoin has enjoyed a wild ride to the moon. At the time of writing, 10,000 bitcoin are worth approximately $291,305,000! Did Hanyecz expect bitcoin to ever become as valuable as it is today? Probably not, but that’s not the point. Hanyecz just wanted to do a simple exchange, bitcoin for pizza. And that’s exactly what he did.
Today, many look at this trade and think, “Oh wow, that guy must feel like a complete buffoon. Who trades that amount of money for two pizzas?” If that is what you think, then I’m afraid you’ve missed the impact of this monumental event. Hanyecz himself said in an interview on CBS47, “People ask me… oh man what an idiot why didn’t you keep that bitcoin? It’s like, well, you know, somebody had to start it off.”
When Hanyecz purchased those pizzas, it established for the first time that bitcoin had market value. Of course, if it wasn’t Hanyecz it would have been someone else, it was inevitable. Hanyecz himself does not regret the purchase and neither should we ridicule him for it. Instead we ought to thank him for pioneering bitcoin adoption.
Bitcoin Pizza Day is one of those stories that, unless it was documented, you wouldn’t believe was real. As with much of Bitcoin’s history, Hollywood couldn’t write a script better than how it actually played out.
Now Bitcoiners on every continent commemorate this event every May 22 by buying pizza and sharing it with family and friends. In an almost religious fashion, Bitcoiners gather to remember the monumental day a humble Floridian in Jacksonville bought some pizza with a new, whacky internet money that only a handful of people even knew existed at the time.
My humble city of Windsor, Ontario Canada is lacking a Bitcoin meetup and community, so I decided to leverage Bitcoin Pizza Day by hosting the first Bitcoin meetup in the border city. As a pastor of a local church, we have the advantage of using our worship space to host the event. Did Hanyecz ever think that his simple two-pizza purchase would domino through time to an event celebrating his purchase at a church in southern Ontario? Probably not, yet here we are! We were able to secure sponsorship from Shakepay and Coinkite and are happy to have Greg Foss coming to do the orange-pilling. It’s sure to be an amazing time.
Maybe you can’t host an event like this, but can you invite your family and friends over for some pizza? Can you share the story of Bitcoin Pizza Day with them while you feed them some delicious cheesy pies? Bitcoin Pizza Day is sort of like the Bitcoin version of Thanksgiving, but instead of turkey, it's pizza. It’s a time for thankfulness and remembrance for how far we have all come. Bitcoin Pizza Day is a reminder that we are going to make it! Bitcoin Pizza Day is also one of the best orange-pilling opportunities of the year.
Consider starting a family tradition. In my home we make homemade pizzas and our children pay for it by sending each other sats (the smallest unit of bitcoin) on the Lightning Network. It’s a day we all look forward to every year. The kids love it, we love it and everyone wins. Get creative with it, use it as a teaching opportunity and have a little fun. So invite your family and friends over, share the story of Bitcoin Pizza Day with them, eat some pizza, be thankful and rejoice.
Bitcoin is a uniting force in this world. Bitcoin is for everyone. Bitcoin doesn’t care if you’re male or female; Bitcoin doesn’t care about your education level or where you were born. Bitcoin is a truth protocol that cannot discriminate. Bitcoin represents freedom from the financial oppression of fiat bankers who have been inflating our savings away for over 50 years.
Whenever I think of Bitcoin Pizza Day, I can’t help but be reminded of the sage wisdom of Andy Bernard, “I wish there was a way to know you’re in the ‘good old days’ before you’ve actually left them.”
Did Laszlo Hanyecz realize he was at the front end of the good old days of global Bitcoin adoption when he posted on bitcointalk.org? Probably not. This Bitcoin Pizza Day, know for certain you are in the good old days, order two pizzas, pay with bitcoin if you can and enjoy the good old days now because there are many good days yet ahead.

386,2022-05-21,2022-05-21,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Varuni Trivedi,finance.yahoo.com,How Can Inflation Affect Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?,"Inflation heavily affects the macro price movement of traditional markets, but many consider the crypto market and bitcoin to be ‘inflation-proof.’ So, how much truth does the same hold?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-affect-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-ethereum-171253075.html,"However, USD’s purchase power against BTC has been in an uptrend for the most part of this year.
Over the last two quarters, amid largely bearish market conditions, socio-political issues have played a key role in establishing BTC’s price trajectory.
Cryptocurrencies as investments are attractive for several reasons. For some, cryptocurrencies are a quick way to earn money as they chant ‘wen Lambo,’ while for others, it’s the trust in blockchain technology or a certain project. For some, getting into cryptos could be as basic as jumping on the hype train, primarily due to FOMO.
All that aside, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have often been called an excellent inflation hedge and a store of value. So, as inflation continues to rise, where do cryptocurrencies and inflation cross paths?
What is Inflation?
Inflation is when the decreasing value of a currency, like the US dollar, increases the price of goods and services over time, thus helping the economy grow. However, unlike fiat currencies, cryptos can’t be manipulated to the same extent by changing interest rates, or so they said.
In early May, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rallied on the news of interest hike by FEDs, rising about 3.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Soaring inflation has been one driver of broad losses across the crypto markets. The United States Federal Reserve announced a 0.5% hike in interest rates, the highest hike ever in interest rates in the last two decades.
While cryptocurrencies saw short-term price spikes after the news of the interest hike, the price gains couldn’t sustain. Many analysts, however, still believe that cryptocurrencies have been behaving in line with equities, similar to a big tech stock.
Bitcoin – an inflation hedge?
In the post-pandemic era, USD’s buying power against BTC fell further, taking a significant dip in March 2020, followed by another drop towards the end of 2020, as seen above. Additionally, the USD’s value has further dipped due to the government’s continuous money printing.
Over the last 50 years, inflation has already reduced the value of the USD by 85%, which strengthened BTC’s narrative as an excellent alternative to fiat money. However, in November 2021, after making an all-time high of $69,000, bitcoin’s price began its downtrend. Around the same time, USD purchase power against BTC started to rise, appreciating in November-end 2021 and then again in March 2022.
Notably, USD’s purchase power against BTC has been in an uptrend for the most part of this year. The same puts bitcoin’s inflation hedge narrative at risk. Additionally, constant issues surrounding market volatility and the high price of a single BTC unit pose friction to investors, especially newcomers.
While investment alternatives like bitcoin mining-backed ETFs and BTC ETPs have offered decent exposure to investors of all sorts, the constant volatility continues to haunt BTC traders and investors and newcomers in the market.
Cryptocurrencies and inflation
For the most part of bitcoin’s existence, BTC prices haven’t reacted negatively to policy uncertainty shocks, partly consistent with the notion of Bitcoin’s independence from government authorities. However, amid largely bearish market conditions, socio-political issues have played a key role in establishing BTC’s price trajectory over the last two quarters.
Furthermore, BTC’s rising correlation with the two major indices—the S&P 500 and Nasdaq- could play a S&P 500 and Nasdaq could play spoilsport in the coin’s inflation hedge narrative as the market matures.
Bitcoin’s price was down 57.02% from its all-time high price of $69,000, which also hampered the top coin’s narrative as a store of value. At the time of writing, BTC traded at $29,504.67, close to the $30,000 psychological support/resistance level.
The coin has maintained a rangebound trajectory between the $31,500 and $28,380 mark since May 10.
For now, with the larger market tilting more towards bearish, whether BTC could outperform traditional assets and fiat currency still remains a crucial question. Many analysts are of the opinion that the maturing bitcoin and cryptocurrency market has given way to diminishing ROIs over the years."

The king coin did witness signs of recovery after the Terra collapse but looks like the crypto gods aren’t as pleased with the coin. Now the question is- Why BTC is down again and is there any near-term recovery in sight for investors?
Let’s find out.
The on and offs of the king coin
Bitcoin prices are below $29k again after the Terra crash. There are suggestions calling out macro headwinds that are responsible for pulling down BTC prices to support levels.
Notably, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ finished their seventh successive week in losses. This is the longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001. Additionally, the Dow is also in its eight successive weekly loss, the longest streak since the 1932 Great Depression.
A Santiment tweet also indicated a correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 index, and how BTC’s upside movement was ‘halted’ by ‘equities.’ The major indices have been witnessing a free fall with the warning signs of recession and looming inflation at large.
Even so, the king coin saw bulls stepping in at the $30k mark only to lose the fight to the bears. At press time, the Fear and Greed Index stood at 13 indicating ‘Extreme Fear.’
What do the charts say?
The metrics are also aligned with the aforementioned information, sending out worrying signals across the Bitcoin network. Investors’ fear can also be perceived through the low transaction volumes.
As per Glassnode reports, the transaction volume dipped to a four-month low on 21 May. This level of an extreme low was also witnessed back in March 2022 when the transaction volume stood at 145,015.1 BTC.
Another metric highlighting a bearish stance on the bitter state of Bitcoin is the NVT signal. The NVT signal on 21 May for Bitcoin stood at a staggering four-year low of 235.2, as per Glassnode.
This suggested that Bitcoin was approaching a local market bottom which historically presents a period of accumulation. However, currently, there is an underlying FUD sentiment in the market because of the discounted prices of assets.
Hang on….. There’s more
Interestingly, renowned crypto analyst Plan B recently tweeted suggesting a trend reversal in the BTC prices. Plan B’s price predictions are widely used for analysis in the crypto community given his 1.8 million Twitter following.
Realized Price / Moving Average (RPMA, purple) shows the #bitcoin cycle best. Relative Strength Index (RSI, yellow) is similar, but can be misleading at critical times (e.g. 2nd half 2021). The good news: bear market is almost over. Waiting for RPMA and RSI to start rising again. pic.twitter.com/Naz2zPV071 — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) May 20, 2022
Plan B used the “Realised Price/ Moving Average (RPMA)” and RSI metrics to conclude a nearing end for the bear market. There is growing confidence about BTC recovery with Plan B suggesting RPMA as being the “best” indicator for Bitcoin. Despite all the bearish signals, Plan B looked hopeful for a quick revival.
Well, no matter what the indicators or analysts say, only time can reveal Bitcoin’s future price trajectory."

Trading veteran Rekt Capital indicated two ways the ""Death Crosses"" pattern might affect Bitcoin's (BTC) price peformance and shared a warning for bulls who are a little too excited.
Two types of ""Death Crosses"" for Bitcoin (BTC)
Rekt Capital compared the historic performance of Bitcoin (BTC) prices in 2013-2021. He compared the ways Bitcoin (BTC) performed after meeting the so-called ""Golden Crosses"" and ""Death Crosses.""
#BTC is down -40% since the Death Cross occurred in early Jan '22
History suggests that whenever a Death Cross occurs, #Bitcoin experiences deeper downside
Now that one has occurred, what could we potentially expect?
Here's a thread with my analysis about the $BTC Death Cross: — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 20, 2022
These signals are registered when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages for Bitcoin (BTC) price lines cross each other: a bullish Golden Cross appears when the 50 EMA spikes over the 200 EMA, while a bearish Death Cross flashes when the 50 EMA drops below the 200 EMA.
Historically, in 2013, 2017 and 2019, the Bitcoin (BTC) Death Cross marked the middle of the recession: the price dropped equally before the Death Cross flashed and after it.
Ads
At the same time, in 2020 and 2021, Bitcoin (BTC) the Death Crosses marked the bottoms; they triggered massive spikes.
According to Rekt Capital, based on ""pre-Death Cross"" performance, Bitcoin (BTC) is following the 2013-2019-ish pattern now.
We're still too early for Bitcoin (BTC) bottom
As such, Bitcoin (BTC) can still drop well lower than it sits nowadays. Based on past performance, an analyst would not be surprised by -55%, -65%, -71%, and even -84% corrections from today's levels.
Given the previous Bitcoin (BTC) peak over $69,000, such a Crypto Winter may send orange coin to $11,000.
By press time, Bitcoin (BTC) is still failing to hold above the $30,000 support level; it is changing hands at $29,319 on major spot platfoms, down 3.29% in 24 hours."

ETH started the weekend trading below $2,000 as the price consolidation in crypto continued. Bitcoin is also trading lower during Saturday’s session, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency once again falling under $30,000.
Bitcoin
Following marginal gains above the $30,000 level during yesterday’s session, BTC once again fell below this point.
Friday saw BTC/USD trading at a high of 30,664.98, however these gains were short-lived, with prices falling to a bottom of $28,793.61 earlier today.
As of writing, prices are down 3.27% to start the weekend, with this decline coming as bulls were unable to sustain the price floor at $28,800.
The recent consolidation in bitcoin comes as a result of increased market uncertainty, following recent actions by the Federal Reserve, leading investors to move away from riskier assets.
This is encapsulated by the fact that BTC has only seen a marginal move in price over the past week, despite all the ups and downs.
Overall and as we speak, prices are down 0.25% from the same point last week, however sentiment seems to be more bearish as we head into the final week of May.
Ethereum
After briefly breaking back into the $2,000 level on Friday, ethereum once again slipped below this point.
To start the weekend, ETH/USD has so far dropped to an intraday low of $1,926.68, which is slightly under its current support point.
Following a bounce above its resistance of $1,950 on Friday, the world’s second-largest crypto token fell below this point earlier today.
However, since reaching these lows, price strength has slightly risen, with ETH now trading $20 above this price floor.
As of writing, the 14-day RSI is still tracking within oversold territory, which is below 30, and close to a resistance of 35.
Bulls will still be optimistic about a potential rebound, providing that we see a breakthrough of the ceiling with the indicator.
Will we see ETH end the weekend trading above $2,000? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

One financial analyst thinks it’s a ‘terrible idea.’,"If you're dreaming of retiring on a bitcoin windfall, you may want to reconsider.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/bitcoin-401k-fidelity-financial-advisers-warn-risk-cryptocurrencies-rcna29099,"If you're dreaming of retiring on a bitcoin windfall, you may want to reconsider.
Bitcoin's recent price fall has captured headlines for its breadth — declining by more than one-third since March and by more than 50 percent since November. Some are now wondering whether the sell-off could reverberate throughout the broader economy.
Over the past week, the price has quietly stabilized at around $30,000. For bitcoin's most ardent supporters — and for those with an extensive risk appetite — it may be a buying opportunity.
The financial services company Fidelity Investments said it was giving companies the ability to offer employees the option to invest up to 20 percent of their 401(k)s in bitcoin. That means people who wants to add bitcoin to their 401(k) would first have to see if their employer offers it.
""There is growing interest from (retirement) plan sponsors for vehicles that enable them to provide their employees access to digital assets in defined contribution plans, and in turn from individuals with an appetite to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their long-term investment strategies,"" said Dave Gray, head of workplace retirement offerings and platforms at Fidelity Investments.
In a follow-up interview, Gray said any company with employees who may be interested in digital currencies like bitcoin as part of the long-term transformation of the financial system should consider the product. It should not, however, be used as a short-term bet on crypto returns, he said.
""For (retirement) plan sponsors that choose to offer our product, it’s an opportunity to ... buy in over time because they may believe this is the right long term investment strategy to supplement a traditional portfolio,"" Gray said.
Does investing in cryptocurrencies make sense for your retirement account?
Even before bitcoin's dramatic sell-off, one analyst came out vehemently against the idea of investing any part of a 401(k) in cryptocurrency. In an April 27 note, Morningstar senior research analyst Madeline Hume wrote:
""While Morningstar is not against cryptocurrency — and full disclosure, I own some bitcoin — Fidelity’s strategy for capitalizing on the crypto momentum is misplaced,"" Hume wrote.
""At this stage, mixing bitcoin and 401(k) plans is a terrible idea.""
The differences between traditional investment vehicles like stocks and bonds and bitcoin are clear.
Stocks and bonds, which make up most retirement portfolios, are backed by underlying cash flows in the form of dividends or interest payments. These allow analysts to model or estimate the future prices of these investments.
On the other hand, bitcoin has no underlying assets, Hume said.
""The absence of fundamentals and valuations makes it a bad fit for a 401(k) plan,"" she said, adding that bitcoin's price is usually driven by speculators. These are individuals who try to convince others that bitcoin's price will continue to go up.
Over time, most stocks or bonds will ultimately increase in value as the underlying companies grow and become more profitable.
But the future price of Bitcoin is nearly impossible to predict, Hume says. It may some day go up again, but its movements are driven more by those speculative narratives.
""Everyone has a neighbor or nephew that hit it big in crypto, but even institutions smell blood in the water on returns,"" Hume said in a follow-up interview. She added: ""There are no shortcuts to retirement.""
That sentiment was echoed by Jackson Wood, a portfolio manager and advisor at Freedom Day, a financial planning advisory. Wood also writes about cryptocurrencies.
""401(k)s and IRAs are very important accounts to nearly every U.S. retiree,"" he wrote in a May 11 feature for the cryptocurrency news site Coindesk.com. ""These accounts are the best tools we have for building retirement portfolios, so the money in these accounts is extremely important to the owner’s future well-being. Allocating to a speculative asset like bitcoin just because it’s suddenly available is not a wise decision.""
Wood told NBC News he did not think many retirement plan sponsors, also known as fiduciaries, would take Fidelity up on its bitcoin 401(k) product.
""Even though it made waves and a lot news, I doubt many fiduciaries will feel comfortable with it,"" Wood said.
Indeed, for more mainstream companies, the product seems to be a no-go. NBC News asked a dozen Fortune 100 companies, as well as Twitter, whether they were making bitcoin available as a choice for their employees’ 401(k)s. Among those who responded, none said they were offering such a product.
What are the risks and rewards of crypto as part of your 401(k) strategy?
Despite the risks, at least one employer has signed up to offer Fidelity's new product to its employees: MicroStrategy, a business and software services company. Its CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal proponent of bitcoin.
""MicroStrategy looks forward to working with Fidelity to become the first public company to offer their employees the option to invest in bitcoin as part of our 401(k) program,"" Saylor said in a statement. ""Teaming with companies like Fidelity that are innovating in bitcoin for corporations is important to us, as is furthering the development of the bitcoin ecosystem for institutional investors.""
Morningstar's Hume said MicroStrategy's announcement is likely part of its brand to be first-movers in the cryptocurrency space. According to a company presentation, MicroStrategy currently holds 129,218 bitcoin; at $30,000 apiece, it is worth a total of about $3.9 billion.
So far, Fidelity is the only large retirement services platform or investment brokerage firm to offer a bitcoin 401(k) product. Vanguard said it had no plans to do so.
""Since cryptocurrencies are highly speculative in their current state, Vanguard believes its long-term investment case is weak,"" it said in a September 2021 note to clients — its most recent opinion on the matter.
In a statement, a Schwab representative said some of its products offer indirect cryptocurrency exposure, but that assets in these products equaled less than 1 percent of total 401(k) brokerage assets at Schwab as of the end of 2021. It did not address whether crypto is a sound investment.
Recent bitcoin decline throws its value into question
Given bitcoin's recent price volatility, it is hard to know when, if ever, bitcoin would begin to be considered a mainstream investment tool.
Meanwhile, Fidelity's product is being offered despite recent guidance from the Department of Labor, which regulates 401(k) plans. The department has cautioned retirement plan managers to be judicious when it comes to cryptocurrencies.
""At this early stage in the history of cryptocurrencies, the Department has serious concerns about the prudence of a fiduciary’s decision to expose a 401(k) plan’s participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies, or other products whose value is tied to cryptocurrencies,"" it said in March, before Fidelity announced it was offering bitcoin. ""These investments present significant risks and challenges to participants’ retirement accounts, including significant risks of fraud, theft and loss.""
In an interview with NBC News, Labor Department acting Assistant Secretary Ali Khawar said that not only is bitcoin too new but that the narratives surrounding it have obscured the larger risks associated with it.
""What we see is a universe where, for an individual saver, or even employers hearing that this is the next sure thing — that there's an element of 'Get in on the ground floor or you’re going to regret it,'"" Khawar said. ""What we don’t hear is the other side of that equation, which is that this is a relatively young asset class, with a lot of difficult questions that are not being answered, like how to value it, or even how it's being stored.""
In response, Fidelity's Gray said he agrees with the department's guidance, though he notes that the company has not banned investing cryptocurrencies outright. He said Fidelity adheres to strict security standards that would meet federal guidelines.
Gray added that he believes a shift is inevitable, citing data that showed younger generations of investors are increasingly tying their future wealth gains to cryptocurrencies.
""Among 'Gen Z,' 39 percent are using it, and for millennials, 38 percent,"" he said. ""So from that perspective, we think the younger workforce will continually look for a benefits program to provide access to investments that they're comfortable with because they've grown up in that environment."""

Additionally, data from Glassnode also revealed...",https://ambcrypto.com/red-or-green-identifying-what-color-bitcoin-btc-is-today/,"The king coin still seems to be in hiding and recovering from what seemed like an exhausting bear chase. Despite Bitcoin’s best efforts of late, BTC slipped back below $30K once again. At press time, it was trading at $29,339 on the charts.
However, does the crypto plan on pleasing the bears for a bit longer, or do the bulls aim to take back their position? Let’s see what the metrics have to say…
Hibernate a bit longer?
2022 hasn’t seen the world’s largest cryptocurrency at its best on the charts. Additionally, data from Glassnode also revealed that the number of whales holding BTC hit a 21-month low of 1,745. Furthermore, the amount of supply last active in the last five to seven years also touched a three-month high of 699,937.
On the contrary, the number of addresses holding more than one BTC hit an ATH of 844,956, despite the ongoing bear market. At press time, the Exchange Netflow Volume also stood at -1,369, indicating an inclination of investors towards holding the crypto.
Does this mean that small-time investors may push the market in the opposite direction? Is BTC sending out mixed signals about its performance?
It may be too soon to say since additional metrics have another story to tell.
The bulls weaken, as the bears strengthen…
At press time, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index projected a sentiment of “extreme fear” as it stood at 14. Also, the NVT and MVRV ratios stood at 43.89 and 1.23, respectively, thus strengthening the bearish sentiment.
Finally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) held its level at 36.55, moving sideways. The Awesome Oscillator (AO), while it flashed green bars, stayed put below the zero line. This hinted at a trend reversal, but combined with bear pressure.
Anticipating a bull run too soon?
As expected, many Bitcoin advocates still vouch for a bullish future. In a tweet, for instance, Jack Mallers, claimed that Bitcoin still is the future of money.
Sidharth Sogani, CEO of Crebaco Global, put out a tweet sharing a timeline of the crypto’s performance. Author Robert Kiyosaki also tweeted in favor of Bitcoin.
Are bears in for the long haul? Seems so…
Despite what Bitcoin enthusiasts feel and no matter what some metrics suggest, most metrics, at press time, indicated that bears will retain power in the short-term. That doesn’t mean Bitcoin is red or green, however. Perhaps, it’s just yellow."

CoinSwitch CEO Ashish Singhal on Sunday called for clearer rules to resolve the regulatory uncertainty in India's cryptocurrency space.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Singhal told Reuters: “Users don't know what will happen with their holdings—is the government going to ban, not ban, how is it going to be regulated? Regulations will bring peace ... more certainty”
Bengaluru-based CoinSwitch, the largest crypto platform in India with over 18 million users, is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and Coinbase Ventures.
In February, about a week after a 30% tax on crypto was proposed, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das, said that private cryptocurrency was “a big threat to our macroeconomic stability and financial stability.”
“Keep in mind,” he added at the time, “that cryptocurrency has no underlying value—not even a tulip.”
Just last month, two major crypto exchanges in India were halted because of regulatory uncertainty.
No official data is available on the size of India's crypto market, but a CoinSwitch estimate provided to Reuters said about 20 million investors had total holdings of roughly $6 billion.
“We are pushing for regulations,” Singhal said at Davos. “With the right regulation, we can get the clarity.”"

Madison Cawthorn is the latest in a series of setbacks for the North Carolina Republican, who lost a GOP primary last week.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/house-ethics-probes-madison-cawthorn-over-cryptocurrency-relationship.html,"Rep.-elect Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., arrives for the House Republican leadership elections at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, November 17, 2020.
The House Ethics Committee is investigating controversial Rep. Madison Cawthorn for his possibly improper promotion of a cryptocurrency in which he may have had an undisclosed financial interest, the panel revealed Monday.
The committee is also investigating the North Carolina Republican over questions about whether he had an ""improper relationship"" with a person employed on his congressional staff, the panel said.
The Ethics Committee authorized the probe by a unanimous vote on May 11. But the panel only disclosed it six days after the 26-year-old congressman narrowly lost a GOP primary, denying him a nomination for a second term.
The loss followed an embarrassing series of events for Cawthorn. He was charged by police in North Carolina with carrying a loaded handgun at an airport and with driving with a revoked license. He also claimed he was a victim of ""blackmail"" following the release of a video that appeared to show him naked in bed with another man.
Cawthorn also infuriated fellow Republicans in Congress earlier this year by claiming some of his older colleagues had invited him to orgies and used cocaine in front of him.
""We welcome the opportunity to prove that Congressman Cawthorn committed no wrongdoing and that he was falsely accused by partisan adversaries for political gain,"" said Cawthorn's chief of staff, Blake Harp, in response to the Ethics probe.
Harp said that the inquiry, which will be conducted by an investigative subcommittee assembled for that purpose, ""is a formality.""
""Our office isn't deterred in the slightest from completing the job the patriots of Western North Carolina sent us to Washington to accomplish,"" Harp added.
Cawthorn later tweeted: ""Wow - I must still be a problem for the swamp! They're still coming after me!""
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., in late April called for the Ethics Committee to investigate Cawthorn for possible insider trading related to cryptocurrency. The Washington Examiner reported that Cawthorn may have broken laws barring investors from profiting on nonpublic information.
The cryptocurrency at issue is the Let's Go Brandon coin named for a derogatory phrase toward President Joe Biden.
In a Dec. 29 reply to an Instagram post featuring a photo of him with the co-founders of the coin, Cawthorn wrote, ""Tomorrow we go to the moon.""
The next day, the team for NASCAR driver Brandon Brown announced that the Let's Go Brandon coin had been signed as the team's primary partner for the 2022 season. After the announcement, the price of the cryptocurrency rose by more than 75%."

While bitcoin turns south, major U.S. stock indices have been in the green. The Nasdaq, which is said to be highly correlated with bitcoin, decoupled from the digital money along with the S&P 500 to denote modest gains near market close on Monday, per TradingView data.

A Tough Year For Bitcoin
Despite making two new all-time highs in 2021, bitcoin already erased nearly all of those gains in 2022.
Bitcoin’s choppy trading year so far can be partly attributed to a broader sentiment of economic uncertainty as the Federal Reserve tightens the U.S. economy, withdrawing liquidity from the market after almost two years of quantitative easing.
The central bank has already raised its basic interest rates two times this year, the last of which was double the magnitude of the previous one and represented the largest hike in two decades: While the Fed increased interest rates by 0.25% in March, it raised them by 0.50% earlier this month.
When the Fed raises or lowers interest rates through its Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), what it is actually doing is setting a target range. The graph above depicts the lower and upper bounds of that target range in red and blue, respectively.
While the U.S. central bank system sets the target, it cannot mandate that commercial banks use it — rather, it serves as a recommendation. Therefore, what banks end up using for lending and borrowing excess cash between them overnight is called the effective rate. This is shown by the green line in the graph above.
The Fed previously hiked interest rates consistently from 2016 to 2019, until plunging it near zero in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, as noted in the graph.
Bitcoin’s higher sensitivity to liquidity and therefore interest rates can be explained by a greater participation of institutional investors in the market, whose allocations are based on the availability of capital and broader economic conditions, Morgan Stanley reportedly said.
Therefore, while Bitcoin was able to sustain a bull market in the midst of the Fed increasing interest rates in 2017, raising nearly 2,000% from January to December that year, the odds aren’t on the side of the bulls this year."

Madison Cawthorn may have improperly promoted a cryptocurrency and engaged in a relationship with an aide.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-ethics-panel-launches-cawthorn-probe-cryptocurrency-improper-rel-rcna30163,"WASHINGTON — The House Ethics Committee said Monday it is investigating whether scandal-plagued GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina may have improperly promoted a cryptocurrency and engaged in a relationship with a congressional aide.
The panel announced it had unanimously voted earlier this month to establish a subcommittee to look into whether Cawthorn “improperly promoted a cryptocurrency in which he may have had an undisclosed financial interest, and engaged in an improper relationship with an individual employed on his congressional staff.”
The ethics committee emphasized that it has not accused Cawthorn of any wrongdoing and that initiating the probe — led by Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, with Rep. Michael Guest, R-N.J., as ranking member of the subcommittee — did not indicate that a violation had occurred.
The American Muckrakers PAC last month filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics citing a Washington Examiner article that named “multiple watchdog groups” suggesting the first-term lawmaker may have violated insider trading laws in an alleged cryptocurrency scheme. In its complaint, the PAC also accused Cawthorn of having a relationship with one of his aides, citing various social media posts that it said “indicate a personal relationship between them, separate and apart from the professional relationship of employer and employee.”
When asked if the House probe stems from the American Muckrakers complaint, the committee said it had no comment.
Blake Harp, Cawthorn's chief of staff, said, “We welcome the opportunity to prove that Congressman Cawthorn committed no wrongdoing and that he was falsely accused by partisan adversaries for political gain.""
The investigation announcement comes nearly a week after Cawthorn, who was backed by former President Donald Trump in this year's GOP primary, lost his bid to be renominated.
The 26-year-old lawmaker caused an uproar this year when he claimed on a podcast that unnamed, older congressional colleagues were using drugs and said some of those colleagues had invited him to a “sexual get-together.”
The committee on Monday also said it will not investigate recent misdemeanor charges filed against Cawthorn over driving with a revoked license and speeding in North Carolina. A spokesperson for the congressman said in response to the charges at the time that his office ""expects the traffic matters to be resolved quickly.""
“The Committee believes that the handling of this matter by local authorities is sufficient given the facts of the matter,” the committee said in a news release."

ASHEVILLE - Rep. Madison Cawthorn will face a House Ethics Committee investigation over his promotion of a cryptocurrency and relationship with a person employed on his congressional staff.
That is according to a May 23 Ethics Committee statement released by Chair Theodore E. Deutch, D-Florida, and Ranking Member Jackie Walorski, R-Indiana. The top ethics members said a subcommittee would be formed to look into the allegations.
""The Investigative Subcommittee shall have jurisdiction to determine whether Representative Madison Cawthorn may have: improperly promoted a cryptocurrency in which he may have had an undisclosed financial interest, and engaged in an improper relationship with an individual employed on his congressional staff,"" the statement said.
The establishment of an investigative subcommittee ""does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred,"" they said, adding there would be no further public comment except in accordance with the committee's rules.
Cawthorn, a controversial Henderson County Republican representing Western North Carolina, lost his first reelection bid in the May 17 primaries amid scandals and missteps that spurred large numbers of Republicans and unaffiliated voters to back alternate GOP candidates, including ultimate winner state Sen. Chuck Edwards.

""Our office isn’t deterred in the slightest from completing the job the patriots of Western North Carolina sent us to Washington to accomplish.”

A call for an investigation of potential insider trading came from fellow N.C. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis April 27. Tillis, who supported Edwards' primary bid over Cawthorn, asked for the probe after a Washington Examiner story in which watchdog groups said the 26-year-old congressman may have engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme by hyping LGBCoin.
The committee did not name the staffer or the specific allegations.
An anti-Cawthorn political action committee, American Muckrakers (also known as FireMadison.com) filed an ethics complaint April 27, alleging Cawthorn was providing employee Stephen Smith more than $250 in free housing and travel as a gift in violation of House rules.

The PAC also alleged other violations regarding Smith (described as the congressman's scheduler): that Cawthorn has loaned the staffer money he had not repaid, that Cawthorn had not filed disclosures about gifts and loans to Smith and that the congressman had a personal relationship with Smith, who appears to live with Cawthorn.
Smith has been the subject of the some of the more recent scandals. In one leaked video the two have an erotic conversation and then Smith appears to put his hand on Cawthorn's crotch.
Chairing the investigation will be Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, with Mississippi Republican Michael Guest as ranking member. The other two subcommittee members will be Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Delaware, and Michelle Fischbach, R-Minnesota.

But there's a potential for more.",https://ambcrypto.com/hot-take-bitcoins-btc-next-bull-phase-might-be-driven-by-energy-companies/,"Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency started a fresh increase from the $28,500 support zone against the US Dollar. At press time, the token crossed the $30k mark as it witnessed a 3% surge in the past 24 hours. But there’s a potential for more. BTC could rally if there is a clear move above the $30,600 resistance zone.
What’s driving BTC now…
Different factors, for instance, institutional adoption, have aided the largest crypto to reach new heights within the crypto market. However, energy companies might be next to drive the next BTC bull run. Ki Young Ju, CEO of analysis platform CryptoQuant, in a series of tweets shared this narrative. In his opinion, energy companies will drive the next BTC bull run alongside traditional finance institutions.
“The first change we’ll see is that the BTC network will be run by solar and wind which became the most cost-effective electricity source lately.”
Here’s a graphical representation of how this might play out:
In fact, the U.S Energy Information Administration’s statistics highlighted that the largest increases in U.S electric power generation for summer 2022 will come from solar and wind. As per the executive, ‘Hydroelectric energy is the most common source for Bitcoin mining globally. It gets used by 62% of crypto miners. Solar and wind take 15-17% for now.’
Hydroelectric energy is the most common source for Bitcoin mining globally, and it gets used by 62% of crypto miners. Solar and wind take 15-17% for now. Last week, @EIAgov said the largest increases in U.S. electric power generation this summer will come from solar and wind. pic.twitter.com/zt78DPzbFP — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) May 23, 2022
Over the years, the Bitcoin mining industry has become more transparent, more sustainable, and better understood. One of the reasons is the sheer support. Blockstream and Jack Dorsey’s Block, formerly known as Square, incorporated a solar- and battery-powered bitcoin mine in Texas that used solar and storage technology from Tesla. Such collaborations could help BTC reach new heights.
“… By collaborating on this full-stack, 100% solar-powered bitcoin mining project with Blockstream using solar and storage technology from Tesla”
Well, price volatility is part of such heights. Consider this, BTC has dropped around 56% since Nov 2021 BUT at the same time, hashrate increased by 75%.
Looking at the graph above, Ki Young Ju declared- “The market is cold, but the fundamentals are full of heat from mining rigs.”
Supporters assemble
Bitcoin HODLers did bear the storm as they continue to hold the flagship coin. For instance, the number of addresses holding 0.1+ coins reached an ATH."

The initiative, coined Sango, was started by the CAR National Assembly with support by President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, per a 24-page document detailing the project’s goals. Sango seeks to “pave the way to a digital future of endless possibilities,” per its webpage. Touadéra tweeted in support of Sango on Tuesday.
In addition to building a legal Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub recognized by its parliament, Sango aims to take “the Bitcoin legacy to the next level” and institute a “cryptocurrency economic zone” in the Sango Island – where users will be able to propose, view and contribute to its future developments.
According to the document, CAR’s plans include “facilitating land acquisition in bitcoin for investors worldwide” and creating a Digital National Bank. The government said in the document that it will also “fully support” access to the country’s natural resources such as gold, diamonds, uranium, lithium and oil.
Sango’s legal framework will include an e-residency program, citizenship by investment, online business registration and no income or corporate tax, per the document. CAR plans to devise this dedicated legal framework before the end of 2022.
The document also mentions the creation of a Bitcoin wallet to send, receive and store BTC that will be compatible with the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s second-layer protocol for cheaper and faster payments. The wallet will also be compatible with point-of-sale (PoS) for businesses to accept bitcoin payments and feature an integrated accounting system.
CAR also plans to finalize the Central African Backbone (CAB) internet interconnection before the end of the year to power its “entire digital transformation,” it said in the document.
CAR last month became the second country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender after El Salvador pioneered in the global scene with its Bitcoin Law in September 2021.
The Sango hub news comes to bring foreign investors to the country, likely in an attempt to further develop a nation that has one of the lowest GDPs, according to World Bank data."
401,2022-05-24,2022-05-24,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,www.marca.com,Bitcoin price: Top 5 reasons why it's collapsing,"Cryptocurrencies are a recurring theme for new investors. The digital part is what moves them the most, besides having high values at the beginning.
Bitcoin, the most popular cryp",https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2022/05/24/628ce805268e3e73048b461f.html,"Cryptocurrencies are a recurring theme for new investors. The digital part is what moves them the most, besides having high values at the beginning.
Bitcoin, the most popular crypto in the world, started with a high value. Just over 100 thousand dollars was what it was worth, but it did not last for long.
As the months went by, Bitcoin fell to below $30,000. But now, a slight rise broke that streak of just over six months and it finally rose above that amount.
Global geopolitics and inflation
Risk factors such as inflation, world geopolitical crisis and local monetary policies are what make its price go up or down.
Stock in the market
Likewise, the stock in the market is something that also influences the price of the cryptocurrency itself.
""Like all risk assets, cryptocurrency prices this year have been disproportionately driven by the war in Ukraine, inflation and the outlook for Federal Reserve policy (in particular, the tapering schedule),"" commented Ben McMillan, CEO of IDX Digital.
Price index and cryptocurrencies
The consumer price index also has an influence within the price of cryptocurrencies.
Having a high index, with a U.S. increase of 8.3 percent over last year, makes investing in these types of coins unattractive to people.
Emergence of new digital tokens
New assets, such as Terra and Luna, also cause the price of this cryptocurrency to be affected.
Disadvantage of Bitcoin's stability
Being two stable cryptos, Bitcoin lose value because investors will only see their money lose and will not make a profit.
Despite the fact that this year it reached a value of more than 40 thousand dollars per Bitcoin, the falls have been greater than the gains and that is why the prices of the most famous cryptocurrency continue to fall."

The day was hailed as momentous in the history of the crypto market and was met with much fanfare. In fact, many proponents claimed that the purchase was just an inkling of what really lay ahead in terms of a global crypto-driven economy.
However, a lot has changed since then, especially with BTC losing 55% off its value after scaling up to its November all-time high of $69,000. And, with Bitcoin’s value seemingly in a downward spiral at the moment, many critics have ramped up their criticism of El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and his decision to keep lapping up more BTC.
To this point, the country’s coffers now contain a total of 2,301 BTC, which are estimated to be worth a little over $67 million at current prices. In fact, reports suggest that Bukele’s gamble on Bitcoin seems to have already resulted in heavy losses equal to the country’s upcoming interest payments.
A rundown of El Salvador’s finances
Estimates suggest that the ongoing crypto downtrend which has caused Bitcoin to lose approximately 40% of its value since late March has deepened El Salvador’s cumulative losses and it’s crypto holdings to about $40 million, nearly equal to the country’s next coupon payment of $38.25 million which is due mid-June.
It is worth noting that since September 2021, Bukele and his team have poured in a whopping $105 million toward buying Bitcoin. However, the flagship crypto has dropped 45% since the country’s first purchase, cutting down the value of the nation’s BTC haul to just $66 million.
At press time, El Salvador owes bondholders a cumulative total of $382 million in interest, which is to be paid out by the end of this year. To this point, in the month of July alone, the country has a payment worth $183 million due.
El Salvador was reportedly in possession of $3.4 billion in its reserves back in April, with Bukele and his team planning on raising another $1 billion using a highly publicized Bitcoin-backed bond. However, the sale of the offering has been postponed multiple times over the past year due to an apparent lack of interest.
Lastly, it is worth noting that since early 2021, El Salvador has been trying to lock in a $1.3 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, an effort that seems to have lost steam following the country’s fierce BTC adoption drive. Regardless, the country needs to bolster its finances since the IMF believes that under its current policies, El Salvador’s public debt will rise to 96% of its GDP within the next 48 months, putting the country on a path of “no return.”

Experts weigh in on El Salvador’s crypto “experiment”
Cointelegraph reached out to Ben Caselin, head of research and strategy at cryptocurrency exchange AAX, for his take on whether El Salvador’s move to invest more money into crypto has been successful. He pointed out that the matter should not be looked into too deeply since Bitcoin’s volatility today is not too different from where it stood last year, adding:
“Irrespective of market conditions, El Salvador is still able to benefit from remittances processed on the Lightning Network, which are cheaper than conventional money operators like Western Union and MoneyGram. The legal tender play also continues to make it easier for El Salvador to attract foreign investment and it continues to provide useful infrastructure for unbanked communities.”
From a purely price-based standpoint, Caselin believes it’s important to provide ample context to investors right now since every country is currently facing some sort of economic pressure. Not only that, but most capital markets including the NYSE, Nasdaq and Dow have also been on the receiving end of a lot of volatility recently. “At this early stage, it’s too early to tell if it was too soon for El Salvador to hold Bitcoin on its national reserves,” he said.
A somewhat similar sentiment was echoed by Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner for crypto lending platform Nexo. He told Cointelegraph that short-term volatility is nothing new to the crypto market and was likely factored in by the El Salvador government when they decided to go ahead with their purchase, adding:
“Yes, El Salvador is in uncharted waters, but it’s far too early for severe skepticism, there is a lot more potential to uncover in this system and it seems Bukele’s administration has the right idea, namely sailing on ahead so that others can learn and benefit from this experience.”
Lior Yaffe, co-founder of blockchain software development firm Jelurida, explained to Cointelegraph that in 2001, the government of El Salvador gave up control of its monetary policy by making the United States dollar legal tender, thus effectively putting the country’s monetary policy in the hands of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. Yaffe added:
“The transition to Bitcoin has been a strategic move to position El Salvador as a local tech hub and lift it out of poverty. As such, it should be viewed as a long term play and should not be judged based on short term price fluctuations.”
More apprehension
With talk of Bitcoin’s volatility taking center stage in recent weeks, it is worth delving into the question of whether El Salvador’s aforementioned losses may dissuade other countries from adopting crypto as legal tender in the future. Trenchev believes that with the right mindset, every country can benefit from one of Bitcoin’s main features: to be a store of value in the face of severe inflation.
He added that while the current bear market is bad, its effects can be seen across numerous sectors including stocks, exchange-traded funds, commodities and indexes — not just crypto.
Not only that, in his view, the adoption of BTC is not just a profit-taking measure but rather an acceptance of the digital currency’s core underlying qualities.

“El Salvador’s example is an indication that the market tumult is, for the time being, not putting off BTC’s adoption as legal tender. Rather, it’s a stress test and if El Salvador pulls through it, crypto adoption as legal tender could be in for its heyday,” Trenchev said.
Adam Boalt, CEO of EarthFundDAO — a decentralizing crowdfunding platform — told Cointelegraph that despite the recent dip and bad press, we’re on course for mass adoption. In his view, once crypto establishes its use beyond just an improved version of fiat, we will continue to see widespread adoption and look back on El Salvador as being “ahead of the curve.”
Jessie Chan, chief of staff at ParallelChain Lab — the firm behind public/private blockchain ecosystem ParallelChain — believes that at this point in time, Bitcoin has become an unstoppable force that no country can afford to ignore, adding:
“El Salvador has shown us what life could be like with the mass adoption of crypto. Buying a cup of coffee, paying your phone bill, it is from the most trivial events that we discover a real transformation.”
Providing a holistic overview of the matter, Chris Trew, CEO of blockchain-as-a-service platform Stratis, told Cointelegraph that, in the long run, El Salvador’s move to acquire more BTC will greatly benefit countries looking to legalize the asset since its adoption has really grown over the last 10 years. “Bitcoin has experienced a bear market before but not a global recession which may be on the horizon. Bear markets are where products are built.”
Bitcoin seems primed to grow
Yaffe believes that any entity that supports Bitcoin adoption — be it a national government or an institutional player — has already factored price volatility into the decision process. And, while seeing the price of Bitcoin plummet is not encouraging in the short term, he is confident that in the grander scheme of things, a decentralized currency offers great benefits for small and poor countries that may be struggling to support their local fiat.
Recent: Crypto inheritance: Are HODLers doomed to rely on centralized options?
Similarly, in Chan’s opinion, the willingness to accept Bitcoin as legal tender is bound to accelerate regardless of the bear market. She noted that the increasingly centralized and politicalized global financial status quo has left people, especially those living in smaller economies, with no choice in the face of losing their autonomy.
Just last week, El Salvador hosted a slew of central bankers and financial authorities from 44 countries in an effort to educate them about Bitcoin and crypto/blockchain-tech in general. To highlight the power of digital currencies, each participating member was given a wallet containing BTC and shown how to use them to facilitate a wide array of everyday purchases.
It will be interesting to see how things shape out for Bitcoin from here on out, especially with inflation levels soaring all over the globe and most experts predicting a bleak future for the global economy. In that regard, if Bitcoin is truly able to transform into an inflation hedge, as many have envisioned it to be, more and more countries may look to adopt the asset in the near-to-mid term."

Despite the crypto slump, banking giant JPMorgan says bitcoin is massively undervalued.
Maintaining its estimate of bitcoin's fair value at $38,000, the bank today reiterated the assessment it gave the asset in February when the cryptocurrency was trading around $43,400. This price ($38,000) is approximately 28% higher than the current $29,757.
TradingView
In a note to clients issued Wednesday, the bank has also stated that it is replacing real estate with digital, or crypto, assets as its preferred alternative asset class along with hedge funds, citing “potential lagged repricing” in private equity, private debt and real estate. Alternative assets typically refer to ​​investments that aren't stocks, bonds or cash.
The appraisal is a nod of confidence to bitcoin, which is currently trading at less than half its all-time high of $68,721, and the broader category in general. In addition to rising interest rates and the fallout from the war in Ukraine, the cryptocurrency market is grappling with the $60 billion collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token LUNA. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies currently sits at $1.3 trillion—a dramatic decline from $3 trillion in November.
“The past month's crypto market correction looks more like capitulation relative to last January/February and going forward we see upside for bitcoin and crypto markets more generally,"" the bank’s strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted in the report.
The strategists also believe that “the trajectory for VC funding would be crucial in helping the crypto market to avoid the long winter of 2018/2019”, which followed the initial coin offerings boom. Just today, Ethereum scaling startup Starkware raised $100 million at an $8 billion valuation and venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz announced that it had raised $4.5 billion for its fourth crypto fund.
“Thus far there is little evidence of VC funding drying up post-Terra’s collapse. Of the $25 billion VC funding year-to-date, almost $4 billion came after Terra,” the strategists noted. “Our best guess is the VC funding will continue and a long winter similar to 2018/2019 would be averted.”"

According to Bloomberg, cited by The Straits Times, OpenNode, a crypto start-up, has partnered with Stripe to allow its customers to accept Bitcoin payments through a new app.
Stripe customers will be able to convert incoming payments and any balance they have into Bitcoin using the app. Lightning Network, which aims to make Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper, is used by OpenNode to settle payments.
Stripe announced in April the option of using a stablecoin payment method through its Stripe Connect service for creators on Twitter. The OpenNode app is another step forward for Stripe into the crypto space. Additionally, Stripe resumed its push into crypto after competitors such as Block, PayPal Holdings and Checkout.com made headway.
Since last year, the company has recruited crypto talent as well as assisted financial exchanges FTX and Blockchain.com with customer verification and online payments. With the OpenNode partnership, Stripe shows a renewed interest in Bitcoin, the world’s largest digital currency, after raising $20 million at a valuation of $220 million in February.

Although that might seem excessive, it does not stand out among some of the largest U.S.-listed tech companies that have also sustained notable losses recently.
In this same 15-day period, Shopify Inc. (SHOP) stock dropped 76%, Snap Inc. (SNAP) crashed 73%, Netflix (NFLX) is down 70% and Cloudflare (NET) presented a negative 62% performance.
Cryptocurrency investors should be less concerned about the current ""bear market"" considering Bitcoin's 79% annualized volatility. However, that is clearly not the case, because Bitcoin's ""Fear and Greed Index"" reached an 8 out of 100 on May 17, the lowest level since March 2020.
Traders fear that worsening macroeconomic conditions could cause investors to seek shelter in the U.S. dollar and Treasuries. Japan’s industrial production data released on May 18 showed a 1.7% contraction year-over-year. Moreover, May 20 retail sales data from the United Kingdom showed a 4.9% decline versus 2021.
Financial analysts across the globe blame the weakened market conditions on the U.S. Federal Reserve's slow reaction to the inflation surge. Thus, traders increasingly seek shelter outside of riskier assets, which negatively impacts Bitcoin price.
Bulls placed most bets above $40,000
The open interest for the monthly May 27 options expiry in Bitcoin is $1.81 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls were caught by surprise as the BTC price has fallen 26% in the last 30 days.
Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for May 27. Source: CoinGlass
The 1.31 call-to-put ratio reflects the $1.03 billion call (buy) open interest against the $785 million put (sell) options. Nevertheless, 94% of the bullish bets will likely become worthless as Bitcoin currently trades near $30,000.
If Bitcoin's price remains below $31,000 on May 27, bulls will only have $60 million worth of these call (buy) options available. This difference happens because there is no use in a right to buy Bitcoin at $31,000 if it trades below that level on expiry.

Bears can secure a $390 million profit on May 27
Below are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on May 27 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:
Between $28,000 and $30,000: 800 calls (buy) vs. 14,200 puts (sell). The net result favors bears by $390 million.
800 calls (buy) vs. 14,200 puts (sell). The net result favors bears by $390 million. Between $30,000 and $32,000: 2,050 calls (buy) vs. 11,200 puts (sell). Bears have a $250 million advantage.
2,050 calls (buy) vs. 11,200 puts (sell). Bears have a $250 million advantage. Between $32,000 and $33,000: 5,650 calls (buy) vs. 9,150 puts (sell). The net result favors bears by $110 million.
This crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.
For example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there's no easy way to estimate this effect.
Bitcoin bears need to sustain the price below $30,000 on May 27 to profit $390 million from the monthly options expiry. On the other hand, bulls can reduce their loss by pushing BTC above $32,000, an 8% rally from the current $29,700 price. However, judging by the bearish macroeconomic conditions, bears seem better positioned for May 27 expiry.

The company’s renewed interest is due to skyrocketing customer interest in crypto payments and increasing competition in the sector.
Reports said that Stripe started building an integrated crypto team in 2021, and onboarded crypto VC Matt Huang in Nov to strengthen its position.
The company’s website states that millions of established businesses and startups use its payments infrastructure and APIs. Meanwhile, Stripe faces competition from rivals like PayPal and Block."

This special explainer on digital assets takes a closer look at the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies.
Why is the crypto market so volatile? Is it safe to buy cryptocurrencies during the “dip?
And why are economists and business leaders, including Warren Buffet and Paul Krugman, calling crypto a “mirage” and predicting its demise, even as many ancillary technologies keep popping up around it?
Experts give their take on why cryptos are jumpy in nature and why the nature of the market is so volatile.
The cryptocrash of 2022
A fortnight ago, Bitcoin took a brutal tumble, dipping (briefly) below $30,000 (Dh110,193) for the first time since July 2021. Currencies such as Ether and BNB have also seen similar falls, leading to many experts talking of a “crypto winter”.
The fall of the Terra stablecoin made the overall crypto market unstable, wiping out more than $200 billion in the cryptoverse. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged or tied to that of another currency, commodity or financial instrument. The value of Luna Terra plunged by about 80 per cent, making the coins almost worthless.
Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous inventor of Bitcoin, designed the currency to circumvent traditional banking infrastructure after the 2008 economic crisis. When introduced in 2009, Bitcoin had a price of zero, and in July 2010, it was $0.09. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has zoomed to the thousands and has also fallen sharply during its short history.
From just around $2 in 2011 to $6,900 in 2020, to almost $70,000 in 2021, before tumbling down below the $30K mark, the digi currency has been doing a volatile dance for the ages. (See graphic).
On May 11, Bitcoin closed at $28,305, the first time it slipped below $30,000 since July 2021.
Why is the cryptocurrency market so volatile?
Dr Pedro Sigaud Sellos, associate dean of the Mohammed bin Rashid School of Communication, programme director and assistant professor of communication and information studies, American Unversity in Dubai, explained: “It all boils down to the logic of markets that follow the principles of supply and demand. The tricky aspect of cryptocurrency is that it is still hard to specify the actual value they bring to their holders.”
How is this currency market similar to the stock market?
The main difference between cryptocurrencies and company stocks, for example, is that the stock exchange trades stocks or shares of a specific company. In contrast, cryptocurrency exchanges trade in digital currencies.
“The company stocks represent a part of the actual company, representing ownership, even if it is a tiny part. There are ways to evaluate the company’s actual value, such as the cash flow statement and the income statement. With cryptocurrencies, their value is subjective, and it is difficult to identify their sources of value,” Dr Sellos explained.
“Finally, the capital volume invested in the stock market is much higher than cryptocurrencies. If you look at the New York Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in the world, they have a market capitalisation of over $27.2 trillion as of 2022. The global cryptocurrency market cap is currently less than two trillion USD,” he said.
Is Bitcoin too volatile to be a currency?
Volatility is a red flag when it comes to adopting the existing cryptocurrencies, said Dr Sellos. “Low volatility means that markets are stable and offer reliable opportunities for investors, with high chances that those markets will offer similar rewards in future. It also means a longer wait for financial compensation,” he said.
However, greater volatility means the financial reward can be higher, but uncertain. The crypto market is still relatively new, so volatility is expected and vulnerable to “big fish” or “whale” traders, the owners of large amounts of crypto. “Since large volumes of crypto are owned by few large investors, their trade decisions can make the crypto market more vulnerable,” he added.
Is it a good idea to buy cryptocurrencies when the prices are low?
The general rule of investment is to “buy the dip”, which can also apply to crypto. “However, I would advise small investors and even large ones to commit only a tiny part to crypto investments, given its volatility,” said Dr Sellos.
“Financial savings for one’s children’s education, for example, shouldn’t be put into crypto. It is advisable that volatile assets represent a small percentage of one’s investment portfolio,” he advised.
Why are economists and business leaders saying crypto will ultimately meet its demise?
Many economists and investors see cryptocurrencies as risky investments, even scams.
Warren Buffet is famous for investing in companies that generate value for shareholders and society, so it is a deal-breaker to invest in something that doesn’t provide any real value.
It is hard to find the actual value generated from crypto, and that’s where the main problem lies with cryptocurrencies in general.
“The fact that they rely on blockchain technology is something that the financial sector and governments will probably learn over time, since blockchain provides many benefits such as security, decentralisation, reduced costs and speed,” explained Dr Sellos.
Will markets stabilise in future and can cryptos be traded like regular currency?
“Only time will tell, but as I mentioned previously, the volume of capital invested in crypto would have to be much higher to see less volatility. It is still hard to tell,” he said.

Now, they're less desirable compared to other investments such as tech stocks and fixed income securities, which means the rest of this year could be terrible for crypto.",https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/dont-expect-to-make-money-on-bitcoin-or-any-other-crypto-this-year/,"Now that Bitcoin has lost more than one-third of its value so far this year, what does the future hold for the famed cryptocurrency, and all other cryptocurrencies, as a hedge against inflation? Getty Images
The price of Bitcoin has collapsed so far this year by more than one third, to $28,793 as of May 24, and is continuing to head south, suggesting that the worst could be yet to come.
Bitcoin, and all the thousands of other coins -- known as altcoins (Ethereum, Tether, Solana, Dogecoin, stablecoins, and the like) -- are unlikely to see much in the way of gains this year. They are ""dead money,"" as the saying goes on Wall Street. And they could fall further as interest rates continue to rise.
Cryptocurrencies, which offer no yield, are now becoming less attractive in a market where rates are driving higher yield on debt instruments that have a guarantee of value. As Alesia Haas, the chief financial officer of Coinbase, the crypto pioneer that handles custody for many crypto buyers, told investors at a conference in March, ""We have incredible macroeconomic uncertainty. We have inflation. We have a lot of people moving to a risk-off mindset in terms of their investing style, and crypto, because of its newness and recency, is a riskier asset class, and so we're seeing money move away from it because of those macro conditions.""
The Federal Reserve Bank's raising of interest rates isn't helping crypto values either. Analyst Chaim Siegel of Elazar Advisors told clients in a note this month, ""The Fed's moves are right now against assets that benefit from inflation with no yield like crypto. I don't think crypto investors think about the Fed but the Fed is shaking the crypto trees right now.""
Already this year, crypto has seriously underperformed most asset classes. The 38% drop in Bitcoin since January 1, is far worse than the 28% drop in tech stocks, based on the return of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index. Ethereum's Ether coin has been an even greater disaster, dropping 48%. (Prices and market returns are as of May 24.)
The deep decline in the Nasdaq presents an additional challenge for crypto. Investors who can suddenly buy some of the best tech stocks for a serious discount may be less inclined to spend their money on such an entirely speculative instrument as crypto.
Faced with a choice on whether to put $100 into Bitcoin, or use the same money to buy a share of Twilio (symbol TWLO) -- a cloud communications tech company that has $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, is growing revenue at 48% a year, and is now down 72% from where it was a year ago -- many investors will choose the latter given the likelihood of Twilio's share price ultimately rising to reflect healthy business fundamentals.
The fact that $100 can buy an actual share of Twilio, versus only a minute fraction -- one-third of 1% -- of one Bitcoin, psychologically adds weight to buying Twilio stock versus the famed crypto coin.
Crypto is further hampered by the fact that it has failed to prove itself as a hedge against inflation. If Bitcoin had maintained its value in the face of record inflation, it might have been a haven for assets. You would have been better off just holding US dollars this year, as the dollar has maintained an exchange value where Bitcoin hasn't. The dollar is up 6% versus the Euro so far this year, for example. With the notion of crypto as a hedge against inflation shattered, a good chunk of crypto's appeal is also destroyed.
A further problem for crypto is the large losses incurred so far by many crypto buyers. Coinbase told Wall Street analysts during its first-quarter conference call this month that deposits have surged by billions of dollars. But trading volume was down 44%, the lowest since mid-2020.
More money on deposit, and lower trading action amidst substantial price declines, suggests clients of Coinbase may have seen declines even as they plowed money into crypto in the past six months. If that's the case, then it's unlikely those buyers are going to add to their crypto holdings while trying to get over their existing losses.
Without forecasting what will happen this year, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong made an ominous statement:
""I think in the up markets, people are irrationally exuberant, and then in the down markets, people are irrationally pessimistic. And remember, this is just like we had one quarter where the market pulled back. I think there will be blood running in the streets if it continues for four quarters.""
You would do well to pay attention to what Armstrong says. Last year, when Bitcoin was vaulting to its all-time high of $68,790 per coin, Armstrong was warning there was a good chance of a major plunge in the currency, and that's what happened.
If Armstrong's prophecy of ""blood running in the streets"" is a likely prospect, then you can expect, at best, very little gain in Bitcoin as investors suddenly seek a haven in fixed income and reasonably-priced stocks.
What will it take to bring crypto back? Either an end to the rate-hike regime; an overbought tech-stock market, where investors start to take profits and look to put money into something else; or a still-rising inflation trajectory that could reignite the idea that crypto is an inflation hedge, even if it's false (after all, some investors have short memories.)
What can you do in the meantime? If you hold crypto, you'll want to hold on to it hoping at some point it will come back. You may, however, want to explore options in crypto staking, whereby you can get paid to lend your Ether and other currencies. You'll be rewarded in the same devalued currencies, but at least when the dust settles, you'll have more coins to show for your pain.

Of all crypto assets, Bitcoin is the face of digital currency that serves as an alternative to central bank control.
Certain people believe that the value of Bitcoin is similar to precious metals.
Indeed, they have similarities. Precious metals and crypto assets have a limited quantity and have specific roles.
People use precious metals in industrial applications. However, Bitcoin serves as a medium for retail transactions and could be more useful in the future.
""Bitcoin demonstrates some attributes of a currency, but its main source of value lies in its restricted supply and increasing demand,"" says John Kelleher, a blockchain software architect and founder of Level K.
""If the price of one bitcoin were to reach $514,000, Bitcoin's market capitalization would reach approximately 15% of the global currency market.""
Where's the value in Bitcoin and other digital currencies?
Money moved from physical attributes onto more functional characteristics.
Bitcoin doesn't need government authorities or an intermediary bank for using it.
""The only way that one would be able to create a counterfeit bitcoin would be by executing what is known as a double-spend,"" Kelleher published.
""This refers to a situation in which a user ""spends"" or transfers the same bitcoin in two or more separate settings, effectively creating a duplicate record.""
Bitcoin's source of value is scarcity.
Similar to gold, crypto investors trade the limited supply and obtain an increasing profit.
Plus, the blockchain is not expensive, and it is effective when a user wants to trade Bitcoin.
""Bitcoin's underlying technology, called blockchain, is tested and used as a payment system,"" Kelleher mentioned.
""One of its most effective use cases is in remittances across borders to bump up speed and drive down costs."""

Blood has been spilled this night.”
These iconic lines from J.R.R Tolkien’s ‘The Lord of the Rings’ could very well apply to the state of the crypto market on 27 May, as Bitcoin crashed below the $29,000 support level. At the time of writing, the king coin was trading at $28,806.53 after falling by 2.94% in the last day and further sliding by 4.45% in the past week.
While bulls hate seeing price falls on most days, the pain was a little higher today, as thousands of Bitcoin options are set to expire.
Not all who invest are bulls
At press time, Coin Options Track revealed that there were approximately 3,054 puts and 1,377 calls set to expire today. While 3 June will see more than 5,000 puts expiring, 27 May is still a red-letter day of sorts. Why? Well, there’s the fact that the maximum pain price of $34,000 is relatively far off from Bitcoin’s press time price.
High call open interest can sometimes serve as a resistance level. In this case, we can see that Bitcoin would have to cross high call volumes at $30,000 and $32,000 before even dreaming of reaching the maximum pain price of $34,000.
That’s why this discrepancy is so surprising. On the other hand, levels seeing a lot of high put open interest included $30,000, $25,000, and even $20,000. As these levels can act as a support, these are important prices to watch as Bitcoin continues to fall in price.
One coin to rule them all
That being said, options are just one part of the bigger picture. An important metric to note is the king coin’s falling exchange outflow volume – meaning that less Bitcoin is leaving the exchanges, or being bought.
So is dip buying fever slowing at last? It looks like it. Data from Glassnode further revealed that Bitcoin’s median transaction volume reached a low of around $316, last seen close to two years ago. In essence, this means Bitcoin transactions are involving smaller sums.
Keeping these factors in mind, you might be surprised to learn that TradingView’s Awesome Oscillator [AO] indicator was painting green bars below the zero line. This shows that in spite of the price movements, there is some bullish pressure working on the asset."
418,2022-05-27,2022-05-27,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Mark Hooson,Forbes Staff,Published,May",www.forbes.com,Bitcoin vs Ethereum,"A rundown of the key differences between the two crypto platforms and their currencies, BTC and ETH.",https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-vs-ethereum/,"Bitcoin and Ethereum are the Coca-Cola and Pepsi of the cryptocurrency space. As the number one and two biggest names in the market, they’re often compared against one another.
From premise to prices, the two concepts are very different. However, there are many similarities to be found. Here’s a look at how the two systems compare.
Before we begin…
Bitcoin and Ethereum are systems, whereas bitcoin (lower case b) and Ether are the cryptocurrencies used by those systems. When comparing the two ecosystems, we need to be clear whether we’re comparing the technology, the assets or both.
In this article, we will refer to the systems by name and the currencies by their stock symbols. For bitcoin, that’s BTC. For Ether, it’s ETH.
How Bitcoin and Ethereum compare
Bitcoin and Ethereum are fundamentally different because the former was designed to enable decentralised finance while the latter was designed to also enable apps and contracts.
While Ethereum does enable payments using its internal ETH cryptocurrency, its scope is much broader than Bitcoin’s – by design.
Both systems use blockchain technology to validate and record transactions, but a forthcoming change to the way Ethereum works will mean the way in which they do it is different, with consequences for speed, sustainability and accessibility.
The difference lies in what’s known as a ‘consensus mechanism’.
What is a consensus mechanism?
A consensus mechanism is a computer algorithm that makes a blockchain viable. It does this by solving what’s known as the ‘double spend’ problem.
A £10 note, once spent, no longer belongs to you, so you can’t spend it again. A BTC is a string of computer code, and could be copied infinitely. In theory, this means you could make yourself as rich as you liked by simply making copies of your BTC and spending it over and over again.
However, when you send someone a BTC, your copy is destroyed and a new version of it is created in the recipient’s account.
This is all recorded on a distributed ledger for the world to see. Since everyone can see on their copies of the ledger that you’ve spent your BTC, you can’t attempt to spend a copied version of it – the consensus of ledger holders would be that you were trying to pull a fast one.
Doctoring one transaction is hard enough, but you’d actually also have to change every subsequent transaction since each one references its forerunners.
This would take an incredible amount of computing power and effort, plus you’d need to control 51% of the distributed ledgers on the network to get the consensus necessary to etch your fake history of transactions onto the blockchain and take your freshly mined crypto as reward.
Bitcoin and Ethereum use different consensus mechanisms.
Bitcoin’s is called proof of work while Ethereum is moving towards a proof of stake consensus mechanism.

Proof of work
This consensus mechanism asks participants to carry out complex computations for the chance to become the user who gets to validate a bunch of transactions and add them to the blockchain – earning a set amount of crypto in the process..
The ‘work’ involves guessing, as closely as possible, a unique, alphanumeric string of 64 characters.
There are trillions of possible combinations to these strings, so those with the most powerful computer hardware can make the most guesses per second within the 10-minute window of opportunity, and have the best chance of being the chosen validator.
In order to get a doctored copy of the ledger validated and added to the block, you’d need to control at least 51% (a consensus) of the computing power of a network, which would be astronomical. This is how the consensus method prevents fraud.
This work used to be done by hobbyists at home, but the processing power needed increases over time, so the ‘mining’ process is now the reserve of companies and specialist organisations – i.e. those who can afford the hardware and the power needed to run it.
Proof of work systems such as Bitcoin have drawn a lot of criticism for the amount of energy expended by the computer hardware involved. Bitcoin currently uses 19 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year. That’s just under the amount used by the entire nation of Norway.
Proof of stake
This consensus mechanism asks participants to stake their own money for the chance to validate transactions and add a block to a blockchain, rather than carry out complex computations.
The more crypto someone stakes, the greater their chances of being chosen to validate a block of transactions to a blockchain and earning a set amount of crypto. The system also discourages bad actors with financial penalties.
Proof of stake stacks the deck in favour of people with more money, but protects against people adding fraudulent records to the blockchain because they’d need to stake at least 51% of the money in the network to control a consensus.
Without the need for powerful computer hardware, proof of stake is considered a more environmentally friendly consensus mechanism than proof of work.
Decentralised payments vs. decentralised software
Bitcoin was developed solely to facilitate decentralised payments, that is, to allow people to send and receive payments without an intermediary such as a bank. Ethereum, on the other hand, was designed to do more than just send and receive ETH.
Using blockchain, which provides an immutable record of transactions, Ethereum was designed to facilitate decentralised software such as smart contracts and distributed apps (dApps).
A smart contract is a digital agreement between two or more parties that will execute itself once certain conditions are met.
For example, Account A will release Asset X once it has received Asset Y from Account B. This could be used to make property sales and the transfer or ownership faster and less liable to fraud.
A dApp is an application that isn’t controlled by a central authority. Twitter is an example of a centralised app, with users relying on it as an intermediary to send and receive messages. As such, users play by the rules it enforces and the algorithm it uses to control content.
A dApp is distributed on a blockchain, with users able to send and receive data directly without the need for an intermediary. Peepeth is a Twitter-like dApp. It claims that as an app it doesn’t optimise for advertising revenues, an issue it says users of centralised apps suffer from.
So while you could say that Bitcoin is larger, but Ethereum is faster, the two aren’t strictly in competition with each other because they’re designed to do different things. BTC and ETH, on the other hand, are directly comparable.
Price volatility
BTC has certainly been more valuable than ETH, peaking at around $64,000 in November 2021. ETH on the other hand peaked at around $4,600 in the same month.
Despite the stark difference in their values, the two cryptocurrencies’ values have historically shown strong positive correlation to each other, trending between 0.7 and 0.8 for much of that time (with 1.0 representing the strongest possible correlation) according to coinmetrics.io data.
Regardless, and as is the case with all cryptocurrencies, BTC and ETH are both volatile. Prices are unpredictable and prone to crashes.
The cryptocurrency market is unregulated in the UK. The UK financial watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued repeated and stark risk warnings to people thinking of investing in cryptocurrency, saying they should be prepared to lose their entire investments with no recourse to compensation."

The CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, has forecasted that Bitcoin will lead the next rally once the US Federal Reserve eases its monetary tightening policy set to start next week. According to Mr. Novogartz, his forecast of a Bitcoin rally will be followed by that of digital assets linked to good projects.
He also explained that the crypto-verse would not go away, and the current pullback results from the industry adjusting to the popping of the asset bubble caused by the same US Fed. He said:
BTC will lead the next rally when the Fed pauses/flinches. Good projects will follow suit. This industry will not go away. We are just adjusting to the popping of an asset bubble caused by the Fed. Building revolutionary tech and change isn’t supposed to be easy.
The Bitcoin and Crypto Bear Market will Test People’s Convictions
In an earlier Tweet, Mr. Novogratz pointed out that the ongoing crypto-market pullback will test investors’ convictions until it finds a bottom.
Furthermore, unlike traditional finance, crypto does not have the corporate buybacks and giant pension rebalancing that are currently causing a short squeeze in the equities market. He shared his insights on the ongoing crypto-market pullback through the following statement.
Crypto trades poorly. This is going to be a period that tests peoples convictions. We will find a bottom when we do. The break from trade-fi markets is because we don’t have corporate buybacks and giant pension rebalancing that is causing this squeeze in equities.
The US Fed Could Pause its Tightening Policy By September
Concerning when the US Fed might pause its monetary tightening policy that begins on June 1st, a recent report by Reuters anticipates that its monetary policy tightening might be paused in September ‘ if there is an economic deterioration and inflation subsides.’
The pause will also probably happen at a time when interest rates will be ranging between 1.75% and 2%. The report by Reuters also quoted a note from Bank of America strategists, which further explained the possibility of a pause by the Fed through the following statement."

‘Women control about 80% of retail spending, and retailers haven’t yet realized that they can save 2%. They usually run on very thin margins so that might like double their profits. They can save 2% just by accepting Bitcoin instead of taking a bank-issued credit card. That can change everything. All of a sudden, all the women will have Bitcoin wallets and they will be buying things with Bitcoin – and you’re going to see a Bitcoin price that’ll just blow right through my $250,000 estimate.’
Draper has been buying Bitcoin for almost a decade – he famously bought 30,000 BTC in a 2014 auction run by the US government, seized from Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road – confident in his belief that at a future date cryptocurrency would be the primary means of payment and exchange. At the time Bitcoin was worth just over $600 per coin – coins he claims to still be holding.
Speaking in 2021, Draper said told CNBC Make it:
‘Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2022 or early 2023. I think I’m going to be right on this one. Bitcoin is sort of like Microsoft in the software world or Amazon in the e-commerce world. I think Bitcoin continues up because there are only 21 million of them. By virtue of its code, only 21 million bitcoin can be mined. Give it about a year and a half and retailers will all accept Bitcoin.’
Tim Draper is in fact tripling down – the Stanford and Harvard Business school graduate first made his $250k Bitcoin prediction in April 2018. Back then Bitcoin was around $8,000.
Draper also commented on decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs):
‘Generally technologies are first taken up by consumers, and then they move to the enterprise. I think you’ll start seeing NFTs go from consumer to enterprise where now your diploma and your driver’s license and your employment history and your medical records and all that stuff will go on to an NFT. DeFi will go from the consumer speculating to the institution moving money around. A DAO can solve social problems. You could have a DAO that benefits shareholders or the DAO owners, benefits customers who get the token for buying the product, benefits suppliers for supplying to that enterprise, and benefits employees for being a part of that enterprise. So it benefits the community around which that enterprise operates, and you would lose all this politics of envy where people are mad at Jeff Bezos for making so much money.’
Tim Draper turns 64 next month in June. He was an early backer of AngelList, Baidu, Coinbase, DocuSign, Hotmail, Ring, Robinhood, SpaceX (Elon Musk has also made bullish Bitcoin price predictions), Tesla, Twitch, Twitter and Skype, with a net worth according to Forbes of $1.2 billion.
He didn’t get everything right in his career, also investing in Theranos – it remains to be seen if his Bitcoin price prediction will play out.
This month the price of Bitcoin price traded as low as $25,200 on some crypto exchanges. It may take a lot longer than the end of 2022 or early 2023 as he predicts, for Bitcoin to even reach $100,000.
However the current bear market, over rising inflation, recession fears and the recent crypto crash, could be compared to the 2020 covid crash – which today is just a tiny wick on the Bitcoin price chart above.

While the Bitcoin community rejoiced in the added resilience to the network owing to the rising difficulty in mining a Bitcoin block, the network difficulty recorded a drop of 4.33% — falling from 31.251 trillion to 29.897 trillion on Thursday.
As Cointelegraph reported on several occasions, Bitcoin’s network difficulty consistently achieved all-time highs over the past ten months as it recovered from a massive drop of 45.4% — from 25.046 trillion on May 29, 2021, to 13.673 trillion on July 22, 2021.
Ever since then, Bitcoin’s network difficulty witnessed a total growth of 128.56% as it surged to its all-time high. Despite the momentary decline of over 4%, however, the BTC ecosystem is still guarded by the most secure blockchain network.
Higher network difficulty demands higher computational power to validate and confirm transactions over the BTC blockchain. As a result, this prevents bad actors from taking over the network by contributing to over 50% of the hash rate and carrying out double-spending attacks.

“What Nayib Bukele did was buy Bitcoins and make a profit at a certain strategic moment,” she said.
The Bitcoin network broke its 10-month-long streak as the network difficulty recorded a drop of 4.33%, standing at 29.897 trillion at the time of writing."

Even as the BTC price fluctuates around the $29,000 range, the top cryptocurrency continues to dominate in terms of market share.
Sharp Fall In Bitcoin Price
BTC’s price fell sharply this year, consolidating most of the gains made in 2021. Concerns over rising inflation and interest rates have predominantly resulted in the losses.
The same factors are still in play, severely dampening the market sentiment around all the cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin. Besides, the altcoins suffered more losses than Bitcoin.
More recently, the meltdown involving the Terra crash led to more losses for crypto investors. The debate around the reliability of stablecoins attracted the need for more and faster regulations in the industry.
When Will BTC Bottom Out?
A cryptocurrency analyst Capo of Crypto cautioned his Twitter followers to be vary of bull traps. He said a new low was incoming.
“Almost the entire market except Bitcoin has made a new low after the bounce, showing that it was in fact a bull trap. BTC new low incoming.”
He said the price range of $21,000 to $23,000 was imminent. “Every bounce is corrective. Bears are in control,” he commented.
According to recent data, the sentiment towards cryptocurrency market is at its worst since the market crash witnessed in 2020 following the onset of Covid pandemic.
As of writing, the price of Bitcoin was trading at $28,866, down by 0.56% in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketcap. Data from last week shows BTC market cap to be around $560 billion, while the current market cap stands at $548 billion.
Despite trading below $29,000, BTC’s dominance in the market has not faded. In fact, Bitcoin’s market dominance is currently the highest in around eight months, according to CoinGecko. With a market cap dominance of around 44%, Bitcoin is strongest now since October last year."

BTC fair price at $38,000
According to the banking giant JPM, $38,000 is the fair price of BTC. Therefore, this signifies that the largest coin by market cap has an upside potential of at least 36% from the current price levels, as per the bank’s note.
Meanwhile, CoinGecko also underlined that the cumulative crypto capitalization globally fell to $1.2 trillion at press time. This was on the back of 137,446 traders reportedly liquidating their holdings, with total liquidations coming in at $517.24 million on Friday.
The note said, “The past month’s crypto market correction looks more like capitulation relative to last January/February, and going forward we see upside for bitcoin and crypto markets more generally,”
The bank’s analysts also noted that crypto is now the preferred “alternative asset” when they stated, “We thus replace real estate with digital assets as our preferred alternative asset class along with hedge funds,”
That said, some crypto industry players believe that the bear market is meant to test the fittest projects. Bertrand Perez, CEO of the Web3 Foundation, told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, “We’re in a bear market. And I think that’s good. It’s good, because it’s going to clear the people who were there for the bad reasons,”
“It’s good also, because all those projects are gone. So the legit ones will be able to focus only on developing on building and forget about the valuation of the token because everyone is down,” Perez added while emphasizing on ‘building’ over ‘valuation’.
BTC gains dominance amid a weak market
Even as Bitcoin remains almost 60% down against its last year’s all-time high of $69,000, the Bitcoin Market Dominance (BTC.D) index is surging.
According to TradingView charts, BTC dominance remains over 46%.
Notably, the index has surged over 5% since May 10, as the altcoin universe is also negatively impacted since the Terra market collapse. Meanwhile, Ethereum, which is the second-largest crypto by market cap, is experiencing a slight delay before the much-anticipated The Merge, leading to investors turning towards Bitcoin.

Companies without a b",https://www.marca.com/en/technology/2022/05/29/6293b025e2704e8f848b4588.html,"The mood in cryptocurrency markets is increasingly being compared to the craze for dotcom companies at the turn of the century, as valuations reach new highs. Companies without a business model and with multi-million dollar valuations went bankrupt when the mania subsided.
Cryptocurrency markets are in a similar situation. The overwhelming majority of the 1,385 coins currently available in the markets are unknown, but they are still being bid up to multi-billion dollar valuations.
As of this writing, Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency created as a parody of the bitcoin boom, has a market capitalization of $1.6 billion. The coin's value is justified by the lack of a clearly defined use case or characteristic.
According to Nolan Bauerle, research director at CoinDesk, 90 percent of today's cryptocurrencies will not survive a market crash. Those who survive will have the upper hand in the game, boosting returns for early investors. And, if RBC Capital's estimate of a future $10 trillion market for cryptocurrencies is correct, those returns are substantial.
However, identifying survivors in the cryptocurrency markets is more difficult than it appears. No single currency has achieved or is even close to achieving mainstream acceptance.
Even bitcoin, the most valuable and widely used cryptocurrency in the world, suffers from scaling issues such as high transaction fees and slow networks.
Which cryptocurrencies will survive?
The top 20 most-traded cryptocurrencies are a good place to start. If and when the cryptocurrency markets crash, it will be relatively easy to identify some notable survivors in this list. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and is quickly gaining popularity as a store of value.
Offshoots such as Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash were born from its blockchain and codebase. Both are vying to be the most popular cryptocurrency for everyday transactions.
Ethereum's world of decentralized applications, or Dapps, is quickly gaining traction, and it's responsible for a slew of tokens built on its platform, including Populous.
Others, such as Dash, have staked similar claims and carved out niches in both emerging and developed markets, such as Zimbabwe and Spain.
NEO has the potential to be a dark horse. It's geared toward the smart economy, and it's collaborating with the Chinese government to expand the country's cryptocurrency ecosystem. It has also collaborated with the Japanese Ministry of Economy and announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft China.
Moving down the list, however, reveals cryptocurrencies that require a higher level of risk tolerance from investors. TRON, for example, a cryptocurrency that has recently risen in popularity, lacks a product and has an inexperienced founder.
Request Network, meanwhile, claims to be the future of commerce, but that vision was recently shifted from one of an online money transfer aggregation service. The white paper for the cryptocurrency mentions a variety of applications for its coin, ranging from the Internet of Things to online payments and implementing business logic for government laws.
However, in terms of partnerships or experience in those areas, the startup has very little to show."

The SEC has denied yet another application to launch a Bitcoin ETF. On May 27th, the Commission issued a notice rejecting the proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust under the NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.
The notice details that the main reason for the rejection is that the proposed rule change fails to meet its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
More specifically, the watchdog outlined Section 6(b)(5) and precisely the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” and “to protect investors and the public interest.”
The SEC outlined that this is the same reason it has been rejecting other spot Bitcoin ETFs and also said that for it to approve one:
“… an exchange that lists bitcoin-based exchange-traded products can meet its obligations under Excange Act Section 6(b)(5) by demonstrating that the exchange has a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement wit a regulated market of significant size related to the underlying or reference bitcoin assets.”

The crypto ‘Big Brother’ is smothering around the $29,000 zone and the future looks bleak at the moment. Bitcoin is about to end the ninth week on the bounce in losses as the larger crypto market continues to take hits.
The downward pressure on crypto since the turn of 2022 has resulted in major crypto losses. Around $1 trillion has already been marked off in the time frame as major cryptocurrencies continue to flounder.
Moving over to this weekend, Santiment reported that the profit ratio of transactions is “dramatically low” for Bitcoin. This is another bearish signal for BTC after the king coin ended another week in losses. Thus, edging closer to capitulation.
According to data analytics platform BitInfoCharts, the number of addresses with a Bitcoin balance worth $1 million or more is 77,994. Among these, 72,130 had a balance of $1 million or more while a total of 5,864 addresses had a balance of $10 million.
Interestingly, as of 5 January earlier this year, there were 90,902 addresses with more than $1 million stored in BTC. A further 8,190 addresses held more than $10 million in Bitcoin on the given date. This represented a nearly 20% drop in addresses holding more than $1 million.
‘The most certain thing in an uncertain world’
In this regard, Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, a renowned Bitcoin investor recently appeared on Fox News. Saylor was full of praise for Bitcoin while quoting its massive growth during the pandemic.
‘Traditional’ indexes such as NASDAQ and S&P 500 were able to record 19% and 29% growth respectively. On the other hand, Bitcoin increased by a staggering 229% in the same time period.
Saylor then discussed his views on accumulation,
“Whenever I have some spare cash, we buy more Bitcoin……The network’s only getting better, adoption is improving, very constructive regulation is coming out of DC….”
When asked if he is buying Bitcoin, he replied saying “I’ll be buying at the top forever.”"

Stocks correlation offers no comfort to BTC bulls
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView flagged the largest cryptocurrency heading for nine weeks of downtrend in a row — the most in history.
Already at a dubious record, Bitcoin’s weekly chart closes provided the backdrop to a weakness that continued to disappoint analysts over the weekend.
Even stock markets, troubled by central bank tightening, managed to put in gains over the week, while Bitcoin and the majority of altcoins added to losses.
“Most concerning has been the divergence between Equities and Crypto. S&P and NASDAQ have traded about 10% higher since 20 May lows while both BTC and ETH have traded lower in the same period,” trading firm QCP Capital wrote to subscribers of its markets newsletter, the latest edition of which was released on May 29:
“This is not the direction of decoupling we were hoping for!”
QCP echoed existing sentiment over Bitcoin’s underperformance compared to previously highly-correlated equities.
Continuing the idea, popular Twitter account Il Capo of Crypto forecast fresh pressure thanks to those indexes now encountering sell-side friction of their own.
“Last time SPX rallied making a new high while $BTC was making lower highs, we saw bearish continuation once SPX reversed. Now SPX is at resistance,” a post on the day read.
Bitcoin faces the “darling dips of May”
With that, BTC/USD was primed to end the month down around 22%.

Bitcoin’s market cap and that of Gold could eventually equalize as they serve the same purpose.
But Bitcoin’s volatility hinders its market cap from growing to the level of Gold.
Analysts forecast that Bitcoin could retest $20k or lower this year.

Furthermore, the report by the team at Fortune also forecasts that the total market cap of Bitcoin and Gold could eventually equalize as they serve the same purpose. But, the market cap of Bitcoin held by institutional investors will not increase soon till its volatility stabilizes to comfortable levels, as explained in the following statement.
…because volatility is so critical when it comes to institutional investors’ risk management, the market cap of Bitcoin held by institutions likely won’t reach gold’s level until its volatility subsides.
Guggenheim’s Chief Investment Officer sees Bitcoin retesting $8k
With respect to Bitcoin’s short-term price movement, the report by the Fortune MAgazine team hinted that BTC could fall to below $20k before the end of this year.
The potential of Bitcoin trading below $20k was also shared by Guggenheim’s Chief Investment Officer, Scott Minerd, in a Bloomberg interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. During the interview, Mr. Minerd stated that he expected Bitcoin to fall to $8,000 and that the crypto market is filled with ‘a bunch of yahoos.’
According to his analysis, Bitcoin, on a fundamental level, should be worth $400,000 primarily due to the US Fed’s ‘rampant money printing.’ However, a flash to $8k might be necessary to allow for further growth. Additionally, he stated that the Bitcoin and Crypto markets have yet to pass the test as credible institutional investments. He said:"

While going through the transaction volumes in the last 24 hours across the major blockchains, Charles Hoskinson sent out the data publicly that would shut the claims of critics saying Cardano blockchain has ghost activities. Co founder and CEO of the research and development responsible firm for Cardano – Input Output Global or IOG, Charles Hoskinson was going through the data on 29th May, sunday.
As per the data based on the research by Messari, Charles Hoskinson showed that Cardano had $9,57 worth transaction volume in 24 hours that makes it second only blockchain network after bitcoin and even higher than second biggest blockchain, Ethereum.
For comparison, at the same time when Cardano had trading volume in 24 hours was $9.24 billion, top cryptocurrency blockchain network Bitcoin had $10.32 while second biggest cryptocurrency blockchain network had $2.52 billion. This analytics might have been a relief for Charles Hoskinson who has been listening for long where Cardano blockchain critics have been calling the blockchain network a ‘ghost chain’ at many instances for a long time now.
Cardano blockchain has been victim of such attacks that went on continuously even after showcasing the data. For instance one twitter user stated on 30th May, that he is no fan of centralized database blockchains like Solana but he calling Cardano a boomer ghost chain said that at least Solana has activities on its blockchain and there are no arguments about it.
Such arguments are nothing new for Cardano where one of the harshest critics of the blockchain network is founding board member of Eaglebrook Advisors, Mike Alfred has seen to enjoy trolling Cardano network and its community. For many instances he has called that the Cardano network has no virtual traffic.
Earlier he had also been seen saying that there were still some remaining signs of enthusiasm and speculations in the market. He, while putting an example, criticized Cardano by saying that no one uses blockchain networks and still it was up by 10%. He said that Cardano would be down by 98% if it just traded on its fundamentals."

But we have prominent investors here making ambitious predictions on how their precious cryptos will turn out in the future. This comes after an unforgettable month that caused massive losses across the crypto sphere, especially during the Terra crash.
Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal recently appeared in a Crypto Banter podcast where he said that Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin.
“If you think of Bitcoin, Bitcoin exchanges more value each week than Ethereum does. Ethereum has a lot of transactions. Transactions are a red herring. Its total value and number of active wallets and Bitcoin beats both. However, if you look at Ethereum, the change in values, the rates of change in those two values in Ethereum is higher, which is why Ethereum’s been outperforming Bitcoin over the last couple of years, and I found it’s really useful. It shows what price is and price is pretty good.”
Pal then reiterated that he is more bullish on altcoins as compared to the “safe haven”. He added,
“If you believe the future is in the technology, in blockchain technology, then this whole digital asset space should outperform the safe haven. That’s just how things work. It always works that way and therefore, there’s a higher beta.”
Well, much to the surprise, there is another prominent crypto investor who believes that Bitcoin can eventually be valued at $250,000 by 2023.
Bitcoin at $250,000 in 2023, really?
Renowned crypto investor Tim Draper has claimed that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 in early 2023. He said this in an interview with well-known crypto trader Scott Melker.
This is particularly a shocking claim after Bitcoin’s own recent struggles. The flagship cryptocurrency might end its ninth consecutive week in losses. Even so, at the time of writing, the king coin was trading at $30,687, up by 5.76% over the last day.
Tim Draper believed the inclusion of women should be a welcoming addition to the crypto market. He remarked that earlier there was a 1:14 ratio of women Bitcoin holders which have dropped down to 1:6. He also anticipates that it will eventually be “even”. The increased participation of women should kick-start the Bitcoin adoption process.
Tim further laid out details about the prediction as he said women control about 80% of retail spending. Draper then added that retailers are yet to realize that they can save up to 2% by accepting Bitcoin instead of bank-issued credit cards. This could potentially double their profits since they run on thin margins."

Bitcoin Crosses $30,000
After weeks of dismal price action, Bitcoin is showing signs of life.
The leading cryptocurrency broke past the crucial $30,000 level early Monday, hours after registering its ninth consecutive weekly red close for the first time ever.
$30,000 has served as an important psychological support level for Bitcoin since early 2021. It briefly dipped below the milestone in July 2021 before surging to an all-time high above $69,000 three months later. However, Bitcoin has been on a sluggish decline since November 2021, finally breaking below $30,000 for a second time earlier this month during a week of chaos that saw Terra’s collapse cause an industry-wide wipeout.
Bitcoin’s price performance has been mirrored by many other crypto assets and traditional equities in recent months amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty. Since the Federal Reserve committed to hiking interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening measures to curb soaring inflation rates, crypto and global markets have suffered from sell-offs. Silicon Valley tech stocks have been among the hardest hit this year, with giants like Amazon and Tesla posting heavy double-digit losses (34.8% and 36.6% respectively).
Last month, Netflix posted a record 38% daily loss after it reported a fall in subscribers in one of the biggest signals yet that the Big Tech bubble may have finally burst. The crypto market, which has traded in close correlation with other asset classes in recent years, has tumbled to a value of around $1.3 trillion after topping $3 trillion seven months ago.
Although Bitcoin has had a shaky few weeks, it showed strength Monday with a 5.2% bounce as global stocks and U.S. futures rallied. European and Asia-Pacific stocks surged as traders have started to place bets on the Fed adopting a less aggressive tightening policy over the coming months. Dow Jones futures are also trading 1.76% in the green, S&P 500 futures are up 2.47%, and futures tracking the Nasdaq Composite Index have gained 3.33%. U.S. markets are closed Monday to mark Memorial Day, with trading set to resume Tuesday.
The crypto market is up 5.3% today with many lower cap assets posting stronger gains than Bitcoin. Nonetheless, with exhaustion from the 2021 bull cycle and a rocky macro climate to contend with, the market has a long way to go before it can reclaim its highs.
According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin is trading at around $30,630 at press time. Its market cap is about $584 billion, roughly 55.7% short of its highs.

433,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,William Suberg,cointelegraph.com,‘Mega bullish signal’ or ‘real breakdown?’ 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week,"Bitcoin breaks higher into the new week, but hardly anyone is convinced by the BTC price relief bounce.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/mega-bullish-signal-or-real-breakdown-5-things-to-know-in-bitcoin-this-week,"Bitcoin (BTC) is bouncing back this week as a sudden surge challenges weekly highs.
In what should provide some desperately needed confidence to bulls, BTC/USD is back at weekly highs on May 30, gaining several percent overnight.
In contrast to recent weekly closes, the May 29 candle managed to limit the downside and reverse course immediately as the new week began.
Nonetheless, Bitcoin has now sealed nine red weekly candles in a row, something never seen before in its history.
Just how bearish is the largest cryptocurrency going into June? The macroenvironment remains troubled, while retail interest is nowhere to be seen and calls for a deeper capitulation remain.
That said, should it continue its latest strength, Bitcoin still stands a chance of breaking out of its current trading corridor.
Cointelegraph takes a look at the factors primed to move the market in the coming days.
Can Bitcoin avoid 10 weeks of red?
Thanks to an unexpected but welcome U-turn overnight into May 30, Bitcoin is breaking with tradition this week.
Asian trading provided the backdrop to some solid gains, with both Japan’s Nikkei and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index up over 2% at the time of writing. The trigger came from news that China is planning to relax some of its latest COVID-19 restrictions and open up the economy.
Bitcoin, nonetheless, outperformed equities prior to European trading getting underway.
After an initial red hourly candle following the weekly close, BTC/USD abruptly rose from $29,300 to current levels nearing $30,700, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.

While caution remains thanks to the weekly close still being red, Bitcoin could end its nine-week losing streak this week as long as next week’s closing price is at least $29,500.
For some, the overnight action alone has been enough to get noticeably more positive on the near-term outlook.
“Bitcoin on the verge of a mega bullish signal,” Jordan Lindsey, founder of JCL Capital,told Twitter followers:
“IMO not a time to be greedy looking for bottom ticks.”
Trader Crypto Tony noted that Bitcoin is still in a familiar trading range and should clear some key levels before being considered to have a firm trajectory. For him, this is $31,000, now not so far away.
Good morning legends
Nice relief waves to see this morning on #Altcoins .. Remember #Bitcoin is still in a range, so we need to clear $31,000 for this relief to continue
Updates to come — Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) May 30, 2022
Others focused on the idea of current gains being just another relief bounce and that Bitcoin should return lower afterward.
This is why you should be able to change your bias as new data comes in
That really was a fake breakdown and now we see the real one #BTC pic.twitter.com/7AXOEffeT0 — CryptoBullet (@CryptoBullet1) May 30, 2022
Popular trading account TMV Crypto, meanwhile, flagged the overnight lows as key support to hold going forward.
“Not sure if we should be very bullish here on BTC + ETH,” fellow trader and analyst Crypto Ed added in a Twitter thread posted on May 30.
He pointed to thin weekend volumes supporting the bounce, suggesting that higher levels did not have the bid interest required to cement themselves as new support yet.
“Saw some on my feed going short, which was understandable when seeing the weakness in the charts,” he continued:
“Once again a great example to be cautious over the weekend. Too often you get played on thin order books hence I prefer to not open new positions over the weekend.”
A CME futures gap left from May 27 at $29,000, meanwhile, provides a further bearish target.

Analyst: Stocks rebound is “bear market rally”
With United States markets closed for a public holiday on May 30, it will be up to Europe and Asia to dictate the day’s mood.
And, with the World Economic Forum behind them, crypto hodlers may be able to breathe a small sigh of relief going into the new month, prior to another U.S. Federal Reserve meeting in mid-June.
Asian stocks’ return to form after eight weeks of losses formed the major macro focus on the day.
After failing to take advantage of a similar rally in the U.S. last week, Bitcoin now appears to be capitalizing on the mood, which commentators nonetheless warn is likely not an indicator of an overall trend reversal.
Monetary tightening from the Fed and other central banks has not only got stock traders down but has ignited talk of a major recession as the price economies pay.
“We are in the middle of a bear market rally,” Mahjabeen Zaman, head of investment specialists at Citigroup Australia, told Bloomberg:
“I think the market is going to be trading rangebound trying to figure out how soon is that recession coming or how quickly is inflation going down.”
The tightening is due to become real this week. June 1 is thought to be when the Fed begins reducing its balance sheet, currently at a record high of $8.9 trillion.
The European Central Bank (ECB) will halt its asset purchases later in the year, it revealed last week.
May 31 will further see consumer price index (CPI) data released for the Eurozone, ahead of similar data for the U.S. on June 10.
“Stock Investors watching for signs of stability,” markets commentator Holger Zschaepitz wrote on May 28 alongside the CBOE Volatility Index:
“Wall St’s fear gauge, investors’ sentiment & bond spreads are tracked for clues on where the market might go next. But only one of the 5 sentiment indicators suggests that the worst is over in the markets.”

Dollar strength tags one-month lows
Coming to test support levels throughout the past week has been the strength of the U.S. dollar.
After surging to levels not seen since December 2002, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) is finally coming back down to Earth and even challenging its year uptrend.
This may still act as a silver lining for risk assets should the trend continue, as inverse correlation has worked in Bitcoin’s favor in particular in the past.
“This could just be the start of the bull run of 2022!” an emboldened Crypto Rover argued, uploading a comparative chart showing the Bitcoin-DXY inverse correlation and how it played out in past years.

Crypto Ed, however, is not convinced that the good times will be back, courtesy of ongoing dollar weakness.
DXY: bounced from my green box, but is was a weak bounce. Rejected at S/R and going down again.
But I see a falling wedge here, don't think this will go much deeper. pic.twitter.com/1ZEtiDbX1v — Ed_NL (@Crypto_Ed_NL) May 30, 2022
“DXY is printing a reversal pattern, a falling wedge. Another reason for not being too enthusiastic for BTC,” a further tweet added.
Nonetheless, at 101.49, DXY was at its lowest since April 25.

Bitcoin nearing a “cyclic bottom”
Not everyone is bearish among Bitcoin analysts, and one of them, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, has the data to prove why.
Uploading the latest readings from Bitcoin’s realized cap distribution, Ki argued that, in fact, BTC/USD is currently at a similar stage to March 2020.
Realized cap reflects the price at which each Bitcoin last moved, and can be broken down into age bands.
These, in turn, show the proportion of the BTC supply that makes up its realized cap which last moved a certain length of time ago.
Right now, 62% of the realized cap involves unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) from six months ago or longer.
For Ki, this signifies floor territory for BTC price, as has been the case historically — and most significantly during the March 2020 COVID-19 crash.
“$BTC is getting close to the cyclic bottom,” he summarized:
“Now UTXOs over 6 months old take 62% of the realized cap. In the 2020 March great sell-off, this indicator reached 62% as well.”

CryptoQuant previously reported on UTXO data as it relates to the size of Bitcoin investor holdings, but drew more conservative conclusions.
Last week, it appeared that the largest Bitcoin whales were still distributing their holdings on-chain, while smaller whales could likely be propping up the market and preventing a March 2020-style cascade.
Sentiment hints at “long term buying opportunity”
It takes a lot of bullish price action to shift sentiment into the green in the current environment.

This goes for both Bitcoin and crypto more widely, as investors have endured over six months of what has been practically unchecked downside.
This remains the case this week — despite the overnight move up, sentiment remains firmly in the “extreme fear” zone across Bitcoin and altcoins.
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is at just 10/100 as of May 30, a score which has accompanied generational price bottoms in previous years.

May 2022 has been a particularly harsh period for sentiment, with Fear & Greed hitting just 8/100 earlier in the month — a level rarely seen and which last appeared in March 2020.
“Fear & Greed Index back down to 10 today,” Philip Swift, creator of on-chain analytics platform LookIntoBitcoin, responded:
“We have spent three weeks in Extreme Fear now with just sideways price action. Potential bottom forming?”
Commentator and analyst Scott Melker, known as the Wolf of All Streets, added that regardless of what might come next, sentiment revealed a “long term buying opportunity.”
“People are still becoming more fearful,” part of a Twitter post read.

434,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Journalist. Reach Me At Luis Itnewsafrica.Com.,It News Africa",www.itnewsafrica.com,Bitcoin - What Happens Next?,,https://www.itnewsafrica.com/2022/05/bitcoin-what-happens-next/,"Bitcoin, the world’s largest and most important cryptocurrency, is currently sitting around $30,000 after losing around 60% of its value in a period of just 6 months in a drop that has led a new round of crypto critics pointing out the unpredictability of virtual currencies .
While Bitcoin has now climbed for a third day (climbing by 3.7%), according to Bloomberg, it hasn’t managed to creep away from the $30,000 level for several weeks now.
The current situation for Bitcoin, and indeed for crypto in general, is negative. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of crypto lender Nexo believes that it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin returns to its 12 May lows of sub-$26,000 levels “given Bitcoin’s failure to mirror the Nasdaq’s gains in the past week.”
“This is the type of de-correlation nobody wanted,” said Trenchev. Previously, Bitcoin enjoyed a record-high correlation with the Nasdaq 100, but now as tech stocks have begun to rally in the past weeks, the crypto’s behaviour in contrast has been disappointing.
Bitcoin’s rise has been waylaid in recent months by the US’ Federal Reserve and other central banks turning towards rate-hiking cycles as Americans feel the pressure of stubbornly high inflation.
The recent collapse of the Terra cryptocurrency ecosystem also added further kindling to the burning fire that is the current sentiment towards digital assets and crypto.
Cryptocurrency trading has faced a bloodbath in recent months. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s net worth has decreased from $13.7 billion to $2.2 billion.
This was not only due to the fall in digital asset prices, but also due to the fall in Coinbase shares, the price of which fell by more than 80%, as sentiment tanked.
The capital of Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the FTX crypto exchange, has halved and now stands at $11.3 billion, and well-known founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency trading platform, brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, have individually lost more than $2 billion, equivalent to almost 40% of their total fortune.
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which gauges the sentiment towards cryptocurrency as a trading asset, is firmly entrenched in the Extreme Fear zone. And the president of Euro Pacific Capital Peter Schiff predicts the fall of Bitcoin to levels around $8,000 with him saying, “We have a long way down.”
Even then, Bloomberg reports, Bitcoin is holding up relatively well compared with some of its contemporary coins, including second-place crypto Ether. Some technical analysis, however, is still flagging concerns over a further Bitcoin slump.
“One final pullback to test 12 may lows near $25,401 still looks more likely before any meaningful low is in place,” wrote Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundrat.

Allen,www.thecoinrepublic.com,Bitcoin Price Analysis: When will Cryptocurrency Investors get Rid of Wrong Speculations?,Bitcoin price is surging and has gained 3.40% of its market capitalization in the last 24-hour period. Trading volume has increased by 33.14% in the intraday trading session.,https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/05/31/bitcoin-price-analysis-when-will-cryptocurrency-investors-get-rid-of-wrong-speculations/,"Bitcoin price Surged above the $31000 mark showing green signals of a No-more bear market bloodbath.
Bitcoin has been consolidating inside a range-bound area, and now finally, after being sideways for almost 20 days of Trading Sessions, finally the traditional cryptocurrency escapes the range.
Other altcoins also started rallying bullish as soon as Bitcoin weathers calm waves of recovery all over the cryptocurrency market.
Bitcoin price is surging and has gained 3.40% of its market capitalization in the last 24-hour period. Trading volume has increased by 33.14% in the intraday trading session. The traditional cryptocurrency Bitcoin just escaped the range-bound area of $28650 and $31200 over the daily chart. Bitcoin(BTC) price is presently CMP at $31637, and the last 24-hour lowest and highest hit by BTC is at $31400 and $31840, respectively. The whole cryptocurrency market showed signs of recovery as soon as BTC started its recovery out of the range-bound area over the daily chart. It’s the traditional ritual as all other altcoins just follow the paved path of BTC in which the whole cryptocurrency market rose from the ashes.
Bitcoin again resembles the Phoenix bird, which is very famous in Greek mythology for rising from its own ashes. Here, the traditional cryptocurrency resembles the traits of the same bird. However, it’s a matter of time to see if BTC sustains above the horizontal range-bound area or if it falters and again gets caught in the consolidation phase. The volume to market cap ratio is 0.06189.
Small whales are becoming increasingly popular in the Cryptocurrency industry, particularly with Bitcoin
Whales are units- individuals, organizations, and exchanges who hold a massive amount of Bitcoin in the market, and small Whales are the ones who hold a significant amount of Bitcoin in the market. It’s not always Bitcoin; it may be any particular token from different cryptocurrencies. Pantera Capital and Fortress Investment Group are two examples of well-known whales. Satoshi Nakamoto, is another giant whale and is also widely speculated in the cryptocurrency world. Satoshi Nakamoto is said to have mined millions of Bitcoin already.
Like other majority stakeholders, Bitcoin whales are also one of them: their actions have an enormous influence on Bitcoin, the traditional cryptocurrency. Bitcoin whales impact the cryptocurrency market through increased volatility, decreased liquidity, or both.
Whales reportedly put significant sell orders lower than the other sell positions in the cryptocurrency market; the price starts falling, causing a chain reaction. The token gains its stability back when the whales pull back their large sell orders from the market or accomplish their goal of creating enough panic to drag the price where they wanted, and as a result, they accumulate more number of coins; this strategy is often known as “sellwall”.
The above TradingView chart shows different levels from where BTC price is coming, and the token currently stands above the horizontal range-bound area over the daily chart. Bitcoin whales are on the move as BTC starts gaining by falsifying the thoughts of Bear Market at the doorsteps of cryptocurrency investors. This may be considered as the stoppage of the bear market, and this bullish momentum of Bitcoin reminds the investors of good old trading days from the Bull run. However, Bitcoin price must sustain above the range-bound area and accumulate above $35000 level to diminish the thoughts of the bear market and save investors from being terrified.
Trading Volume Spikes

According to Coinglass, the trading volume for Bitcoin and different altcoins have gained massively in the last 24-hour period. Bitcoin price has gained around 3.61% today and also volume has massively increased to $19.04 billion in the intraday trading session. After Bitcoin and Ethereum the one who gained massively is WAVES coin by acquiring around 3.48 Billion of volume in the last 24-hour period and that’s quite huge for the altcoin like WAVES.
Bitcoin Price: Technical Analysis
Technical indicators suggest the uptrend momentum of Bitcoin over the daily chart. However, the Ichimoku cloud indicates the red cloud over the BTC price, signifying the higher level of the token. Relative strength index showcases that Bitcoin is breaking out of neutrality. But it looks like BTC bulls falter to sustain at the current level, and Bitcoin may fall back into the range-bound area. MACD exhibits the bullish momentum of Bitcoin over the daily chart. The MACD line is ahead of the signal line after a positive crossover.
Conclusion
Bitcoin price is surging and has gained 3.40% of its market capitalization in the last 24-hour period. Technical indicators suggest the uptrend momentum of Bitcoin over the daily chart. However, Ichimoku cloud indicates the red cloud over the BTC price signifying the token’s fall from the higher level. Bitcoin whales are on the move as BTC starts gaining by falsifying the thoughts of Bear Market at the doorsteps of cryptocurrency investors.

The pair thus capped the second day of more bullish momentum, this nonetheless failing to impress analysts, who widely believed that the moves were untrustworthy.
Those misgivings continued on the day amid discussions over whether the latest gains amounted to a “dead cat bounce.”

“BTC is poised for a bigger move. Before you ape in, remember how crypto likes to squeeze shorts and trap longs,” on-chain analytics resource Material Indicators wrote in one of several tweets over the past 24 hours:
“You can mitigate risk by waiting to confirm breakout or fakeout. FireCharts shows where liquidity rests in the order book. Monthly close Tues.”
Order book data from major exchange Binance, meanwhile, showed a solid $61 million sell-wall appearing at $33,500 at the time of writing.

Popular Twitter account Il Capo of Crypto further continued a bearish stance while admitting that the bounce had run contrary to previous forecasts.
Nice push from the bulls yesterday. This week I've been mostly wrong because I thought we were going down and didn't expect this bounce. However, this move up is showing the same signs as the move that deviated above 45k-46k.

Fellow account Venturefounder added that BTC/USD would need to reclaim its 200-day moving average near $43,000 to “resume a new bull market,” calling such a target an “uphill battle.”
Whales bide their time
Amid unimpressive volumes accompanying the bounce, meanwhile, additional concerns focused on whales.

As noted by Caue Oliveira, analyst at Brazilian analytics outfit BlockTrends, Bitcoin’s largest entities have yet to show faith in recent lows being a macro floor.
“Whales/institutions not yet deployed all their firepower on the market!” he summarized in a Twitter thread:
“These large entities continue to reduce activity, exposing their caution with the global scenario. A close look at their moves can provide the true signal of a real reversal.”
An accompanying chart showed a steep drop-off in whale movements in May.

Continuing, Oliveira said that activity from institutional platform Coinbase Pro likewise suggested that most investors were waiting on the sidelines.
“At the moment, I don’t see any evidence of a real ‘buy the dip’ by these participants,” he added.
Whale-focused monitoring resource Whalemap further contended that without a piercing of the 200-week moving average, Bitcoin had not yet put in a true macro bottom.

ADA is currently trading at $0.67, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
ADA is the native token of Cardano, the proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain that offers stiff competition to Ethereum.
The token is now the sixth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $22.6 billion, overtaking Ripple’s XRP.
Despite today’s bullish action, ADA is still down 78% from its all-time high of $3.10 recorded in September 2021.
There has been a sharp rise in the coin’s trading volume across major cryptocurrency exchanges too. Its trading volume hovers around $2.4 billion over the past 24 hours, 272% up from the previous trading day.
What’s driving Cardano?
The primary reason behind today’s bullish action has been increased DeFi activity on the layer-1 blockchain and the launch of Lagon’s cross-chain bridge.
In August 2021, Cardano launched its Alonzo fork bringing the ability to develop DeFi applications on top of Cardano. Following the Alonzo fork, the coin jumped more than 116% in less than a month, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Since the launch of the Alonzo fork, a total of 92 decentralized apps are built on Cardano according to Cardano's showcase.
Today, many of these applications are seeing an uptick in activity.
According to Defi Llama, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on Cardano rose by 30.56% over the past 24 hours, indicating increased DeFi activity. The TVL on Cardano currently stands at $194.87 million up from $149.25 million recorded yesterday.

Minswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform and the largest DeFi protocol on Cardano showed increased user activity too. The TVL on the platform increased 21.7% from $56.13 million to $74.01 million over the past 24 hours, according to data from DeFi Llama.
Other than Minswap, other protocols include WingRiders (a DEX platform), Sundaeswap (also a DEX), and Meld (a lending protocol) also reported an increase of TVL by at least 15% over the past 24 hours.
Apart from TVL, the total transaction volume on the Cardano also saw a steep increase from $9.57 billion to $14.24 billion over the past 24 hours, according to data from Messari.
Elsewhere, on May 25, Lagon tweeted about the launch of a cross-chain bridge to facilitate token transfers between Ethereum and Cardano. The bridge currently supports only USDC, but will also soon open up to all ERC-20 tokens.
“We believe that our solution powered contributes Cardano development & growth,” tweeted Lagon, the organization responsible for the development of Ethereum and Cardano cross-chain bridge.
Meanwhile, the largest cryptocurrency on the market, Bitcoin (BTC), is up 2.95% over the past 24 hours and currently trades at around $31,559.
Ethereum (ETH) is up 3.26% over the past 24 hours and currently changing hands at $1,970.

439,2022-05-31,2022-05-31,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Shawn Amick,bitcoinmagazine.com,"Russia Is Open To Bitcoin, Crypto For International Payments",A senior official from the Central Bank of the Russian Federation said it is open to using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for international payments.,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/russian-central-bank-open-to-bitcoin-and-crypto-international-payments,"The central bank of Russia is open to allowing the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for international payments.
A senior official for the bank explained that it still believes that risk for Russia could be “reasonably large.”
Russia has experienced a lot of turbulence on the matter of bitcoin and mining this past year.
The Central Bank of the Russian Federation is open to allowing the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for international payments, according to a report from Reuters.
“In principle, we do not object to the use of cryptocurrency in international transactions,” said first deputy governor of the central bank, Ksenia Yudaeva.
However, the financial authority’s open-mindedness only stretches so far.
Yudaeva continued to explain “We still believe that the active use of cryptocurrency within the country, especially within Russia’s financial infrastructure, creates great risks for citizens and users. We believe that in our country those risks could be reasonably large.”
The continued Russian debate on not only the use of currencies like bitcoin, but also the process of mining bitcoin have become hot-button topics over the last year. Just this January, the central bank proposed a blanket ban on mining bitcoin.
Russia’s President took the opposing position of the central bank stating “Although, of course, we also have certain competitive advantages here, especially in the so-called mining,” referring to the nation’s natural climate and energy surpluses.
The Russian government proposed a bill seeking to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time, Andrey Lugovoy, first deputy head of the Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption for the State Duma, the federal assembly of the Russian Federation, said:
“When we talk about digital financial assets, about cryptocurrency, about the crypto market, we must understand that we are not just trying to amend certain bills, we are trying to regulate a new entity that the whole world is facing, and we must determine our position.”
Russia’s Ministry of Finance followed the government’s proposal with a bill of its own which intended to respect the Bitcoin ecosystem and empower those operating businesses within the space by assigning regulatory practices. Now, some members of the Russian Federation believe bitcoin is only a matter of time.
Denis Manturov, Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, offered his opinion on May 18:
“The question is when it will happen, how it will happen and how it will be regulated. Now both the Central Bank and the government are actively engaged in this.”"

The move back to $30,000 simply confirms the strong correlation to traditional assets and in the same period, the S&P 500 also retreated 0.6%.

Weaker corporate profits could pressure the stock market due to rising inflation and the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, according to Citi strategist Jamie Fahy. As reported by Yahoo! Finance, Citi’s research note to clients stated:
“Essentially, despite concerns regarding recession, earnings per share expectations for 2022/2023 have barely changed.”
In short, the investment bank is expecting worsening macroeconomic conditions to reduce corporate profits, and in turn, cause investors to reprice the stock market lower.
According to Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist of GMO, “We should be in some sort of recession fairly quickly, and profit margins from a real peak have a long way that they can decline.”
As the correlation to the S&P 500 remains incredibly high, Bitcoin investors fear that the potential stock market decline will inevitably lead to a retest of the $28,000 level.

The correlation metric ranges from a negative 1, meaning select markets move in opposite directions, to positive 1, which reflects a perfect and symmetrical movement. A disparity or a lack of relationship between the two assets would be represented by 0.
Currently, the S&P 500 and Bitcoin 30-day correlation stands at 0.88, which has been the norm for the past couple of months.
Bearish bets are mostly below $31,000
Bitcoin's recovery above $31,000 on May 30 took bears by surprise because only 20% of the put (sell) options for June 3 have been placed above such a price level.
Bitcoin bulls may have been fooled by the recent $32,000 resistance test and their bets for the $825 million options expiry go all the way to $50,000.

A broader view using the 0.77 call-to-put ratio shows more bearish bets because the put (sell) open interest stands at $465 million against the $360 million call (buy) options. Nevertheless, as Bitcoin currently stands above $31,000, most bearish bets will likely become worthless.
If Bitcoin's price remains above $31,000 at 8:00 am UTC on June 3, only $90 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because there is no use in a right to sell Bitcoin at $31,000 if it trades above that level on expiry.
Bulls might pocket a $160 million profit
Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 3 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:
Between $29,000 and $30,000: 1,100 calls vs. 5,100 puts. The net result favors bears by $115 million.
1,100 calls vs. 5,100 puts. The net result favors bears by $115 million. Between $30,000 and $32,000: 4,400 calls vs. 4,000 puts. The net result is balanced between call (buy) and put (sell) instruments.
4,400 calls vs. 4,000 puts. The net result is balanced between call (buy) and put (sell) instruments. Between $32,000 and $33,000: 6,600 calls vs. 1,600 puts. The net result favors bulls to $160 million.
6,600 calls vs. 1,600 puts. The net result favors bulls to $160 million. Between $33,000 and $34,000: 7,600 calls vs. 800 puts. Bulls extend their gains to $225 million.
This crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets, and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.
Bears have less margin required to suppress Bitcoin price
Bitcoin bears need to pressure the price below $30,000 on June 3 to secure a $115 million profit. On the other hand, the bulls' best case scenario requires a push above $33,000 to increase their gains to $225 million.
However, Bitcoin bears had $289 million leverage short positions liquidated on May 29, according to data from Coinglass. Consequently, they have less margin required to push the price lower in the short term.
With this said, the most probable scenario is a draw, causing Bitcoin price to range near $31,000 ahead of the June 3 options expiry.

442,2022-06-02,2022-06-02,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Michael Nderitu,ambcrypto.com,Bitcoin: Fed's hawkish view may be scary but here's why BTC will survive,Bitcoin can’t seem to catch a clean break ever since it crashed to its current range in mid-May. That remains the same narrative today...,https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-feds-hawkish-view-may-be-scary-but-heres-why-btc-will-survive/,"Bitcoin can’t seem to catch a clean break ever since it crashed to its current range in mid-May. That remains the same narrative today after the Federal Reserve commenced its quantitative tightening measures.
Bitcoin tanked by more than 5% following the start of Fed’s QT measures. FED will reportedly reduce its balance sheet by $47.5 billion in the first three months from today. That figure will increase significantly in the months to come. The Bitcoin drop came as a surprise because it ended May with bullish signs. Its bearish performance in the last few weeks also indicated that higher interest rates were priced in.
Will the quantitative tightening measures extend Bitcoin bear dominance?
It looks like the QT measures are bad news for Bitcoin bears. Higher interest rates will likely shift investors’ risk appetite in favor of risk-off assets such as bonds. Investors already knew this was coming, hence many of them have likely already taken executed precautionary measures.
If that is the case, then the latest Bitcoin and crypto market downside might be the result of sellers taking the opportunity of selling opportunities. It would also explain why the drop was not as pronounced. Some of Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics support this observation.
Bitcoin’s exchange inflow volume increased from 39,104 to 55,195 in the last two days. However, its exchange outflow volume increased by a bigger margin from 34,210 to 55,180. Another translation for the observation is that there was sufficient demand to catch BTC at lower prices.
Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio is currently at 0.27 which is close to its monthly low. This reflects the availability of exchanges after the selloff that took place in the last few months. Its realized profit metric dropped to $265 million in the last 24 hours, which means only a small percentage of BTC holders are currently in profit.
In other words, there is less pressure to sell. The good news is that the Bitcoin volatility index increased to 107% after hovering just above 60% in May. Low profitability and increased volatility may yield more buying pressure.
Conclusion
The risk of more BTC downside cannot be understated, but it appears there is still healthy demand providing healthy support just below the $30,000 price level. However, it might be a good idea to wait and see how Bitcoin and the rest of the market will behave in the next few days. The lack of more downside will be a good sign that the QT is already priced in."

The committee’s chairman, state Sen. Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, told CoinDesk in May that he was worried the bill could lead to “deleterious economic consequences for New York if people perceive it as being hostile to crypto.”"
444,2022-06-02,2022-06-02,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,news.bloomberglaw.com,,"The Biden administration is teeing up policy recommendations to lower cryptocurrency mining’s energy consumption and emissions footprint, marking its first major foray into a poorly understood industry that critics say threatens U.S. climate goals and strains the power grid.",https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/crypto-miners-energy-climate-costs-draw-white-house-scrutiny,"The Biden administration is teeing up policy recommendations to lower cryptocurrency mining’s energy consumption and emissions footprint, marking its first major foray into a poorly understood industry that critics say threatens U.S. climate goals and strains the power grid.
“It’s important, if this is going to be part of our financial system in any meaningful way, that it’s developed responsibly and minimizes total emissions,” Costa Samaras, principal assistant director for energy for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told Bloomberg Law.
“When we think about digital assets, it has to be a climate and energy conversation,” Samaras said.
The report, expected in August, could be one of the first studies following President Joe Biden’s executive order in March pressing federal agencies to ensure the “responsible” mining of digital assets such as cryptocurrency.
Carrot or Stick
But whether any policy action follows the recommendations remains unclear.
The Energy Department, which issues efficiency standards and studies clean technology, was unable to provide a person to speak on cryptocurrency energy usage. The Environmental Protection Agency broadly doesn’t regulate energy usage by specific consumers or industries. The EPA’s inaction on the issue drew criticism from some congressional Democrats in April.
Some see the role of the federal government as shaping disclosures to investors who will then push crypto miners to clean up their operations.
“I have a really hard time seeing some sort of a stick approach,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web, a technology company that works with utilities and consumers to accelerate decarbonization. “I think the most bang for their buck is going to be on education and disclosure of bitcoin mining—and that would send a huge signal, too.”
Last month, Energy Web unveiled a scoring system that would show how Bitcoin miners—and potential other industries—are using their consumption to drive lower emissions.
“The big indicator that we’ve got traction is when an investor comes out and says, ‘That’s what I want to use,’” Morris said.
Strained Sector
The energy-intensive process of mining—completing and verifying transactions of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other decentralized digital tokens—is hitting an electric sector already facing a cascade of demands from extreme weather, aging wires, a shift to renewable energy, and a push to electrify transportation.
The study aims to drill down into claims that have touted cryptocurrency as a societal benefit or criticized it as a local nuisance and a climate nightmare, said Samaras, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who was tapped last November for a new White House energy team.
The team plans to assess everything from local noise pollution to the energy efficiency of using different mining techniques—comparing Bitcoin’s proof-of-work technique with proof-of-stake, which is used by other cryptocurrencies and is more than 99% more energy efficient.
“We’ve seen reports about noise, local pollution, older fossil generators being restarted in communities,” Samaras said. “These are not trivial loads.”
This year, Ethereum is planning a switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Bitcoin, despite public campaigns calling for it to follow suit, has announced no plans to do so, and there appears to be little interest in such a change. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain means that a diverse group of miners—who last year earned more than $15 billion, according to data from The Block Research—would have to be brought on board.
More Power Than Pakistan
Cryptocurrency mining depends on large amounts of energy. As more people have filled their digital wallets, the crypto industry has seen a 20-fold boom in demand in electricity over the last five years, by one measure.
Mines, or mining farms, may consist of thousands of servers stacked in warehouses. They deploy raw computing power to solve a series of complex math problems, consuming more electricity each year than many individual countries, including Pakistan and Finland, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Its global annual consumption is roughly equal to all the lights and televisions in the US combined, the index estimates.
The “very first thing” the White House should address is measuring the scale of the industry, said Matteo Benetton, a finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-authored a report on cryptocurrency mining in Upstate New York.
The study, published last year, found mining in the region pushed up monthly electric bills by about $8 for households and $12 for small businesses. Local government tax revenue increases from the mining development offset only about 15% of the hiked costs to locals, according to the study.
As miners have headed to areas with cheap power and cooler weather to run their servers—often with generous government subsidies—a database showing location, power consumption, and local impacts offers benefits, Benetton said.
These databases “could be very valuable to judge how much electricity they’re consuming or some of the claims I’ve heard recently that they are even improving the network, increasing the flexibility, and so on,” Benetton said. “If some of these companies are doing good for the grid, why don’t they disclose the data?”
Company Registry
Some comments on the March executive order have urged the White House to create a registry of companies that use the more intensive proof-of-work technique.
Then the Energy Department should issue an efficiency standard that would move miners away from that method, according to comments filed by Greenpeace, Environmental Working Group and Earthjustice.
The EPA should institute stringent reviews of every air and water permit issued or renewed for any proof-of-work mining operations, the groups wrote. Such policies are crucial to meeting the Biden administration’s goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by 2035 and across the U.S. economy by 2050.
“Many of the most noxious mining operations can operate as-of-right under preexisting and permissive air and water permits or zoning regulations, despite the change in operations and the negative impacts to local residents and the climate,” the groups wrote.
Turning Off Servers
The White House energy team will be keeping an open mind as it collects evidence, Samaras said.
“We need to think about what would be the appropriate policy responses under a world that shifted to proof-of-stake, or a world that has some continuous mix of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake,” Samaras said. “Proof-of-work is energy-intensive by design, but it also increases security.”
The team will study claims made in recent months—in places like Texas—that mining facilities could provide grid operators with flexibility by agreeing to temporarily shut down during times of peak demand.
A central question, Samaras said, concerns the economic incentive for miners to turn off their servers, given the opportunity to make money by running all the time.
“We’ve seen miners set up in places where the electricity prices are low and they’ve secured favorable industrial rates,” he said. “I would like to go see the evidence that an afternoon peak mining tariff slows down mining operations.”"
445,2022-06-03,2022-06-03,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,www.politico.com,New York lawmakers pass first-in-nation cryptocurrency moratorium,The measure exempts operations that have already secured or applied for new or renewed air permits and the bulk of facilities in New York that rely on power from the electric grid.,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/03/new-york-pass-cryptocurrency-moratorium-00036946,"The measure exempts operations that have already secured or applied for new or renewed air permits and the bulk of facilities in New York that rely on power from the electric grid. Still, supporters who pushed aggressively see it as an important step to avoid increased emissions from the industry restarting old power plants.
“The New York Senate has stood up for New Yorkers and our landmark climate law with the passage of this crucial bill to address cryptomining in fossil fuel power plants,” said Liz Moran, New York policy advocate for Earthjustice in a statement. “With this bill’s passage, the legislature has rightly said fossil fuel power plants can’t get a second life in New York just for private industry gain, which would fly on the face of the state’s climate mandates.”
The bill would also require a study of the industry and its environmental impacts by the Department of Environmental Conservation. The cryptocurrency industry and business groups pushed back hard on the measure, arguing it would have a chilling effect and misrepresenting it as a wholesale ban on mining digital currencies.
The sponsor of the bill, Sen. Kevin Parker (D-Brooklyn), had given up hope of passing the measure on Wednesday. Legislative officials indicated there were enough votes to pass but that leadership was leery of bringing the bill forward.
Some lawmakers, particularly those with cryptocurrency and blockchain companies in their districts, raised concerns about the impact of the moratorium. The industry has warned the bill will chill investment in the state.
“The message won’t be about the details… It’ll be about an emerging industry New York is saying no to,” said Sen. Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester), whose district encompasses the headquarter of Foundry, a digital currency industry company that has lobbied extensively against the moratorium. “Every job matters for me in Rochester.”
The Senate passed a broader moratorium last year, and the measure was revived after a concerted push by environmental groups and other supporters.
The battle over the bill will now move to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desk. The governor has not staked out a position and has punted on a renewed permit for an existing gas-powered cryptocurrency mining operation in the Finger Lakes region that spurred the push for the bill.
“This is a significant setback for the state and will stifle its future as a leader in technology and global financial services,” said Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, an industry group in a statement on the expected passage of the bill.
“Our sincere hope is that Governor Hochul will see the devastating effect this moratorium will have on New York and not sign this bill.”"

The measure establishes a two-year moratorium on new permits for cryptocurrency mining operations that use proof-of-work (PoW) authentication methods to validate Blockchain transactions.
The measure also initiates a study on the environmental impact mining facilities are having in New York state.
The Senate voted 36-27 in favour of the new bill.
It now goes to the desk of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it, reports The Verge.
Hochul reportedly received a $40,000 donation last month from a chief executive of a company that runs a former aluminium plant turned crypto-mining facility.
The bill was passed by the NY state Assembly last month.
It would impose a moratorium on any new PoW mining projects powered by carbon-based fuel in the state.
However, existing crypto mining operations undergoing the permit renewal process would be allowed to continue.
According to Coindesk, mining companies based in New York have threatened to leave the state if the moratorium is passed.
The bill “is a grim day for blockchain technology, effectively shutting the door on a nascent industry,” said Clark Vaccaro, acting president and chief strategy officer at industry trade organisation BaSIC.
“The regulatory environment in New York will not only halt their target — carbon-based fuel proof of work mining — but will also likely discourage new, renewable-based miners from doing business with the state due to the possibility of more regulatory creep,” John Warren, CEO of institutional-grade bitcoin mining company, GEM Mining, told CNBC.
Bitcoin (BTC) mining is a very electricity-intensive process. A recent study has shown that a single Bitcoin transaction consumes about 2165 kWh of electricity which a regular household in the US would use in 74 days.
One of Botcoin’s core features, its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, is every miner’s headache. PoW requires them to solve complex equations for a share of newly-mined coins.
PoW has also come under criticism for its environmental footprint and critics hold that it is a wasteful and unsustainable crypto for the universe.
Studies have shown its carbon emissions to match those of entire nations.
One of the studies estimates that Bitcoin emits nearly 114 megatonnes of CO2 annually, a value comparable to Czech Republic’s."

The measure now heads to the desk of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it. If Hochul signs the bill, it would make New York the first state in the country to ban blockchain technology infrastructure, according to Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Industry insiders also tell CNBC it could have a domino effect across the U.S., which is currently at the forefront of the global bitcoin mining industry, accounting for 38% of the world's miners. The New York bill, which previously passed the State Assembly in late April before heading to the State Senate, calls for a two-year moratorium on certain cryptocurrency mining operations which use proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions. Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, is used to create bitcoin. Ethereum is switching to a less energy-intensive process, but will still use this method for at least for another few months. The push for an eleventh-hour vote came as leadership in the state capitol managed to flip some of the senators who were previously undecided. Lawmakers backing the legislation say they are looking to curb the state's carbon footprint by cracking down on mines that use electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels. If it passes — for two years, unless a proof-of-work mining company uses 100% renewable energy, it would not be allowed to expand or renew permits, and new entrants would not be allowed to come online. The net effect of this, according to Boring, would be to weaken New York's economy by forcing businesses to take jobs elsewhere. ""This is a significant setback for the state and will stifle its future as a leader in technology and global financial services. More importantly, this decision will eliminate critical union jobs and further disenfranchise financial access to the many underbanked populations living in the Empire State,"" Boring tells CNBC. It is a sentiment echoed by Galaxy Digital's Amando Fabiano, who says that ""New York is setting a bad precedent that other states could follow."" As for timing, the law would go into effect as soon as the governor signs off.
The irony of banning bitcoin mining
One section of the bill involves conducting a statewide study of the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining operations on New York's ability to reach aggressive climate goals set under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which requires New York's greenhouse gas emissions be cut by 85% by 2050. Boring tells CNBC the recent swell of support in favor of this year's proposed ban has a whole lot to do with this mandate to transition to sustainable energy. ""Proof-of-work mining has the potential to lead the global transition to more sustainable energy,"" Boring told CNBC's Crypto World, pointing to the irony of the moratorium. ""The bitcoin mining industry is actually leading in terms of compliance with that Act."" The sustainable energy mix of the global bitcoin mining industry today is estimated to be just under 60%, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce has found that the sustainable electricity mix is closer to 80% for its members mining in the state of New York. ""The regulatory environment in New York will not only halt their target – carbon-based fuel proof of work mining – but will also likely discourage new, renewable-based miners from doing business with the state due to the possibility of more regulatory creep,"" said John Warren, CEO of institutional-grade bitcoin mining company GEM Mining. A third of New York's in-state generation comes from renewables, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. New York counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100% carbon free electricity goal, and the state produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains. The state also has a chilly climate, which means less energy is needed to cool down the banks of computers used in crypto mining, as well as a lot of abandoned industrial infrastructure that's ripe for repurposing. In a conversation at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami in April, former presidential candidate and New Yorker Andrew Yang told CNBC that when he speaks to folks in the industry, he has found mining operations can help develop demand for a renewable source of energy. ""In my mind, a lot of this stuff is going to end up pushing activity to other places that might not achieve the goal of the policymakers,"" said Yang. Some in the industry aren't waiting for the state to make a ban official before taking action. Data from digital currency company Foundry shows that New York's share of the bitcoin mining network dropped from 20% to 10% in a matter of months, as miners began migrating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions in other parts of the country. ""Our customers are being scared off from investing in New York state,"" said Kevin Zhang of Foundry. ""Even from Foundry's deployments of $500 million in capital towards mining equipment, less than 5% has gone to New York because of the unfriendly political landscape,"" continued Zhang.
The domino effect
If the crypto mining moratorium is signed into law by the governor, it could have a number of follow-on effects. Beyond potentially stifling investment in more sustainable energy sources, industry advocates tell CNBC that each of these facilities drives significant economic impact with many local vendors consisting of electricians, engineers, and construction workers. An exodus of crypto miners, according to experts, could translate to jobs and tax dollars moving out of state. ""There are many labor unions who are against this bill because it could have dire economic consequences,"" said Boring. ""Bitcoin mining operations are providing high-paying and high-grade, great jobs for local communities. One of our members, their average pay is $80,000 a year."" As Boring points out, New York is a leader when it comes to state legislation, so there is also the potential for a copycat phenomenon rippling across the country. ""Other blue states often follow the lead of New York state and this would be giving them an easy template to replicate,"" said Zhang, Foundry's SVP of Mining Strategy. ""Sure, the network will be fine — it survived a nation-state attack from China last summer — but the implications for where the technology will scale and develop in the future are massive,"" continued Zhang. However, many others in the industry think concerns over the fallout of a mining moratorium in New York are overblown. Veteran bitcoin miners like Core Scientific co-founder Darin Feinstein say the industry already knows New York is generally hostile to the crypto mining business. ""There's no reason to go into a region that doesn't want you,"" said Feinstein. ""Bitcoin miners are really a data center business, and the data center needs to locate in jurisdictions that want to have data centers within their borders...If you're going to ignore that, then you have to deal with the consequences of conducting business in a region that doesn't want your business."" Feinstein and other miners point out that there are plenty of friendlier jurisdictions: Georgia, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming have all become major mining destinations. Texas, for example, has crypto-friendly lawmakers, a deregulated power grid with real-time spot pricing, and access to significant excess renewable energy, as well as stranded or flared natural gas. The state's regulatory friendliness toward miners also makes the industry very predictable, according to Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners. ""It is a very attractive environment for miners to deploy large amounts of capital in,"" he said. ""The sheer number of land deals and power purchase agreements that are in various stages of negotiation is enormous.""

448,2022-06-03,2022-06-03,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Jordan Finneseth,cointelegraph.com,5 reasons why Bitcoin could be a better long-term investment than gold,"Crypto advocates often refer to Bitcoin as “digital gold,” but how does BTC stack up against gold as a long-term investment?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-reasons-why-bitcoin-could-be-a-better-long-term-investment-than-gold,"The emergence of forty-year high inflation readings and the increasingly dire-looking global economy has prompted many financial analysts to recommend investing in gold to protect against volatility and a possible decline in the value of the United States dollar.
For years, crypto traders have referred to Bitcoin (BTC) as “digital gold,” but is it actually a better investment than gold? Let’s take a look at some of the conventional arguments investors cite when praising gold as an investment and why Bitcoin might be an even better long-term option.
Value retention
One of the most common reasons to buy both gold and Bitcoin is that they have a history of holding their value through times of economic uncertainty.
This fact has been well documented, and there’s no denying that gold has offered some of the best wealth protection historically, but it doesn’t always maintain value. The chart below shows that gold traders have also been subject to long bouts of price declines.
Gold price. Source: TradingView
For example, a person who bought gold in September of 2011 would have had to wait until July 2020 to get back in the green, and if they continued to hold, they would once again be near even or underwater.
In the history of Bitcoin, it has never taken more than three to four years for its price to regain and surpass its all-time high, suggesting that on a long-term timeline, BTC could be a better store of value.
Could Bitcoin be a better inflation hedge?
Gold has historically been seen as a good hedge against inflation because its price tended to rise alongside increases in the cost of living.
But, a closer look at the chart for gold compared with Bitcoin shows that while gold has seen a modest gain of 21.84% over the past two years, the price of Bitcoin has increased 311%.
Gold vs. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
In a world where the overall cost of living is rising faster than most people can handle, holding an asset that can outpace the rising inflation actually helps increase wealth rather than maintain it.
While the volatility and price declines in 2022 have been painful, Bitcoin has still provided significantly more upside to investors with a multi-year time horizon.
Bitcoin could mirror gold during geopolitical uncertainty
Often called the “crisis commodity,” gold is well-known to hold its value during times of geopolitical uncertainty as people have been known to invest in gold when world tensions rise.
Gold is called the crisis metal so I’d assume if we enter into a recession again, gold will go up as a commodity — Scott Hempstead (@scottytrip1) April 22, 2022
Unfortunately for people located in conflict zones or other areas subject to instability, carrying valuable objects is a risky proposition, with people being subject to asset seizures and theft.
Bitcoin offers a more secure option for people in this situation because they can memorize a seed phrase and travel without fear of losing their funds. Once they reach their destination, they can reconstitute their wallet and have access to their wealth.
The digital nature of Bitcoin and the availability of multiple decentralized marketplaces and peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins provides a greater opportunity to acquire Bitcoin.
The dollar keeps losing value
The U.S. dollar has been strong in recent months, but that is not always the case. During periods where the dollar’s value falls against other currencies, investors have been known to flock to gold and Bitcoin.
If various countries continue to move away from being U.S. dollar centric in favor of a more multipolar approach, there could be a significant amount of flight out of the dollar but those funds won’t go into weaker currencies.
While gold has been the go-to asset for millennia, it’s not widely used or accepted in our modern digital society and most people in younger generations have never even seen a gold coin in person.
For these cohorts, Bitcoin represents a more familiar option that can integrate into people’s digitally-infused lifestyles, and it doesn’t require extra security or physical storage.

Bitcoin is scare and deflationary
Many investors and financial experts point to scarcity and supply constraints for gold following years of declining production as a reason gold is a good investment.
It can take five to ten years for a new mine to reach production, meaning rapid increases in supply are unlikely and central banks significantly slowed their rate of selling gold in 2008.
That being said, it is estimated that there is still more than 50,000 metric tons of gold in the ground, which miners would happily focus on extracting in the event of a significant price increase.
Gold will never reach the promised land of 'true scarcity'. The more the price inches up, the more it is mined, thus increasing supply, which then lowers the price. #bitcoin #gold #goldprice — DeepSee-er (@ErDeepsee) March 7, 2022
On the other hand, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million BTC that will ever be produced, and its issuance is happening at a known rate. The public nature of the Bitcoin blockchain allows for the location of every Bitcoin to be known and verified.
There’s no way to ever really locate and validate all of the gold stores on this planet, meaning its true supply will never really be known. Because of this, Bitcoin wins the scarcity debate, hands down, and it is the hardest form of money created by humankind to date.

However, at press time, BTC was trading below the $30K level and stood at $29,648 down by 2.6% in the last 24 hours.
BTC slipping below the $30k level may be a scary sight, especially after May, but the token has been showing some sort of improvements in its trajectory of late. As per data from CoinGecko, the token was up by 3.7% considering its performance in the last seven days. Furthermore, according to a tweet put out by the crypto education platform, Bitcoin Expert India, Bitcoin’s dominance, at press time, stood at 47% of the total cryptocurrency market.
A bull on the loose, then?
With an overall improvement in the cryptocurrency market, the king coin has shown signs of positive recovery. But, the bulls don’t seem to be in full control yet.
As per a tweet put out by Santiment, Bitcoin, on 3 June, witnessed massive trading volume in the last seven days and had the second-largest total trading volume since the token’s all-time high.
📊 #Bitcoin highlighted another major week full of major trading volume. Between the top 8 largest non-#stablecoins, the past 7 days were the 2nd largest total trading volume since $BTC's #AllTimeHigh, only trailing the massive dip week in early May. 🤯 https://t.co/DOJDWmxgww pic.twitter.com/I7GkFWNhso — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 2, 2022
Furthermore, Bitcoin’s exchange netflow volume stood at -23,286 as of 3 June. It someway asserts that Bitcoin permabulls have been still buying the dip.
Additionally, the MVRV ratio stood at 1.25 on 3 June from 1.28 on 2 June. Thus, indicating that 44% of BTC holders are facing losses at the current price level. On the other hand, the NVT ratio stood at a score of 20.95 on 3 June, a drastic drop from the 53.16 that it stood at on 29 May.
The Awesome Oscillator (AO) flashed green bars on its histogram. But, it stayed below the zero line, indicating that the token’s road to recovery is going to be slow and steady. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), for most of its sessions, moved sideways, below the neutral line. And, stood at 43.81, during press time.
Despite the unwelcoming month of May, the token has tried to regain its stride in the month of June. It is also expected that the token would perform better in the future given investors’ faith.
Additionally, crypto analyst Edris, posted a series of tweets, pointing out that the next few months could be a great opportunity for long-term investments considering that long-term HODLers have entered a phase of capitulation.

Long-term holders begin ‘distribution’
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD stuck between $29,000 and $30,000 into the weekend.
The pair had managed a revival to near $31,000 the previous day, but the last Wall Street trading session of the week put pay to bulls’ efforts.
As “out-of-hours” markets offered thin volumes but little volatility, eyes were on the potential direction of what would be an inevitable breakout.
“The weekly chart on Bitcoin looks nothing short of horrific and so the trend continuation remains. I do think we consolidate a little longer in this range before dropping eventually,” Crypto Tony announced on the day in part of a series of tweets.
A further post reiterated a target of between $22,000 and $24,000 for Bitcoin once that forecast drop took hold.
“I am looking for another drop down to $24000 - $22000, but of course distribution takes time. So we may be hovering around this support zones before any drops just yet,” it read.
Others planned to make the most of incoming weakness, including popular Twitter account Cryptotoad, which announced a strategy of accumulating at $27,000 and under in what would be a “swing low” for BTC/USD.

As Cointelegraph reported, other sources keenly eyeing lower lows for Bitcoin range from on-chain analysts to well-known pundits such as ex-BitMEX CEO, Arthur Hayes.
Adding fuel to the fire was data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, which signaled that long-term holders were starting to divest themselves of their stash in a classic bear market move.
“Long-term holders capitulation phase has begun,” contributing analyst Edris summarized in one the site’s QuickTake market updates released on June 3.
Commenting on a chart of long-term holders’ Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), Edris drew comparisons to conditions that preceded generational bottoms in Bitcoin’s history. These included the 2014 and 2018 bear markets, as well as the COVID-19 cross-market crash of March 2020.
“Currently, the long-term holders are entering the capitulation phase and are selling at a loss, indicating that the smart money accumulation phase has begun, and the next few months would present a great opportunity for long-term investing in the market,” the post read.
It noted that such a capitulation event “usually marks a multi-year bottom.”

In a hint that some were already buying the dip, meanwhile, exchange data showed that outflows were beating inflows markedly in recent days.

According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, on June 3, netflows from major exchanges totaled -23,286 BTC, the most since May 14.

Discussing long-term holder behavior earlier in the week in the latest edition of its newsletter, “The Week On-Chain,” Glassnode lead on-chain analyst Checkmate additionally delineated classes of investor currently least interested in selling.
Specifcally, those who bought near the November 2021 all-time highs “appear to be relatively price insensitive,” he wrote, adding that the investor profile was increasingly composed of such stubborn hodlers.
“Despite continued drawdowns in price, and a major spot liquidation event of 80k+ BTC, they remain unwilling to let their coins go,” he added.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart: BTC prepares to push higher?
On the 4-hour chart, we can see bulls steadily taking over the momentum as further downside could not be reached overnight.
Bitcoin price action has seen swift retracement over the past days. From the previous high set at $32,250 on 31 May 2022, BTC/USD has already retraced over 9 percent to the $29,500 low.
From there, BTC attempted to continue higher during the middle of the week. However, bullish momentum ended as soon as the $30,500 mark, meaning a strong lower local high was set.
Bearish momentum returned soon after, pushing back to the $29,500 previous low and briefly testing below it. Since support was found around the same area, we can see that a double bottom reversal pattern is set, meaning more upside should soon follow.
Bitcoin price should next start moving higher as a result of this price action development. Most likely, we will see another attempt to break past $31,000 over the next days, which should open the way for a lot more upside later in June.
Bitcoin price analysis: Conclusion
Bitcoin price analysis is bullish today as we have seen failure to break significant further lows over the last 24 hours. Therefore, BTC/USD should reverse from the $29,500 mark and look to head higher by the end of the weekend.

454,2022-06-04,2022-06-04,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Mackenzie Sigalos,www.cnbc.com,Senator Anna Kelles interview,Assemblymember Anna Kelles speaks to CNBC about her New York mining moratorium bill.,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/04/new-york-crypto-mining-bill-senator-anna-kelles-interview.html,"Bitcoin offices in Istanbul, Turkey, on May 11, 2022.

New York State Assemblymember Anna Kelles is tired of all the fear-mongering about the bill she wrote — and sponsored — to place a two-year moratorium on certain types of new cryptocurrency mines in the state. The fate of the measure, which passed the state senate in the wee hours of Friday morning, rests in the hands of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it. ""It's important to understand that it's not a ban,"" Kelles said in a call with CNBC on Friday. ""It's like a three-page bill. So it would be wonderful to just have people read it, but it often ends up being an interpretation based on emotions."" The legislation aims to curb the state's carbon footprint by cracking down on crypto mines that meet very specific criteria. For one, they need to use the energy-intensive proof-of-work authentication method to validate blockchain transactions. Second, they must draw electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels. Within that subcategory of mines, the measure only applies to those looking to expand or renew permits, while new entrants would not be allowed to come online. Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, is virtually synonymous with bitcoin. Ethereum is switching to a less energy-intensive process, but will still use this method for at least for another few months. ""If there is a cryptocurrency mining operation, like there is one in Syracuse, where there are thousands of cryptocurrency mining computer processors, and they are directly tied into the grid: It is not a moratorium on that facility,"" explained Kelles, who disclosed to CNBC that she does not own any cryptocurrencies but actively researches the sector. In addition, it won't affect existing operations in power plants because it's not retroactive, nor will it impact ""boutique or small-scale cryptocurrency miners that are doing, you know, four, five, ten, twenty computers in their basement,"" she said. Kelles says that her bill is essentially just a big pause button, designed to halt the actions of a corner of the state's crypto mining industry running on coal- and natural gas-based power plants. Those energy sources interfere with the state's aggressive climate laws requiring it to become net-neutral in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. ""It's very narrow, and it won't, in any way, affect anyone's ability to buy, use, sell or invest in any cryptocurrency, including any cryptocurrency that is based off of proof-of-work validation methods like bitcoin,"" continued Kelles.
Crypto bloc blowback
The crypto mining industry has banded together to challenge the legislation. Miners tell CNBC that even though this bill is relatively narrow, they're concerned about the possibility of regulatory creep. ""A moratorium and ban on how a miner sources energy — behind the meter versus grid — is not hospitable to miners,"" said Marathon Digital's Fred Thiel. ""New York has a grid congestion issue which is not at all impacted by behind-the-meter energy consumption,"" continued Thiel. ""In the end, this is sending a message to miners to stay away from New York, because these are only the first steps in what may become a wholesale ban of mining in the state."" Miners make large capital investments that can require up to five years to provide a payback, plus return on investment. Thiel says that no company is willing to risk investing in a state where after two years, or even sooner, they might be forced to shut down and relocate. Kelles tells CNBC that crypto miners challenging the bill sound a whole lot like the oil and gas industry. She says both use lines, such as, ""If you do this, in the future, it will put a damper on free trade and free commerce – and any regulation is bad."" She also isn't worried about crypto miners leaving New York because ultimately, like any company, their interest is profits. Miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry where their only variable cost is typically energy, so they are incentivized to migrate to the world's cheapest sources of power – which also tend to be renewable. New York is a bastion of cheap and renewable energy, which is a huge draw for the industry. A third of New York's in-state generation comes from renewables, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the state produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains. ""The oldest and largest cryptocurrency mining operation in the country is in New York State, and it is fully on hydroelectric. Hydroelectric can't be picked up and moved,"" said Kelles, who also noted that hydropower is the cheapest form of renewable energy. In addition, the state has a chilly climate, which means less energy is needed to cool down the banks of computers used in crypto mining. New York has a lot of abandoned industrial infrastructure that's ripe for repurposing, as well. ""To say that miners can pick up and leave and go to any state and have access to that form of energy...I think that it is fear-mongering to say that,"" said Kelles.
It's like a three page bill. So it would be wonderful to just have people read it, but it often ends up being an interpretation, you know, based on emotions. Anna Kelles Assemblymember
However, some data suggests miners began leaving New York for friendlier political jurisdictions like Wyoming and Texas last year, ahead of the anticipated crackdown. Data from digital currency company Foundry shows that New York's share of the bitcoin mining network dropped from 20% to 10% between Oct. 2021 and the end of January. ""Our customers are being scared off from investing in New York state,"" said Kevin Zhang of crypto mining pool Foundry. ""Even from Foundry's deployments of $500 million in capital towards mining equipment, less than 5% has gone to New York because of the unfriendly political landscape,"" continued Zhang.
Deciding who to regulate
The real sticking point of the legislation comes down to the question of who to regulate: The proof-of-work crypto miners or the energy generators. ""It is a two-year moratorium on the use of power plants,"" Kelles said. ""Some of my colleagues say, 'You know, this is really a power plant bill.'"" That logic irks some crypto miners. ""If this was only about refiring coal-fired plants then it would be much easier – and more fair – to just ban refiring coal-fired plants,"" said Thiel. ""Problem solved."" Some of the biggest names in bitcoin — including Jack Dorsey, Tom Lee, Nic Carter, and Michael Saylor — recently co-signed a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency in which they took issue with congressional Democrats conflating data centers with power generation facilities. The issue was totally separate from New York's moratorium bill, but the same reasoning applies. The rebuttal letter said data centers that contain ""miners″ are no different than data centers owned and operated by Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. According to the letter, each is just a building in which electricity powers IT equipment to run computing workloads. ""Regulating what data centers allow their computers to do would be a massive shift in policy in the United States,"" the letter read. Kelles says the New York bill isn't singling out crypto miners over other large energy consumers — it's just that ""there are no other energy consumers that are buying power plants."" ""This is not about the industry, this is about the use of power plants,"" she said. But Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter makes the case that New York is now ""regulating the contents of the data center"" and has effectively ""banned a kind of computation."" ""They're directly controlling what constitutes a valid use of power,"" Carter wrote in a tweet.
Unemotional policy decisions"
455,2022-06-06,2022-06-06,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,,www.politico.com,The Senate’s crypto queen has a sweeping new Bitcoin bill,The contents of the bill will likely shed light on who holds sway in the ever-expanding universe of crypto lobbying.,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/06/lummis-and-gillibrands-crypto-hype-machine-00036712,"“This is the starting point for discussions about what the law should look like,” said Miles Jennings, crypto general counsel and head of decentralization at Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture firm that’s a major investor and lobbying force in the world of digital assets. “I think that is one of the reasons we’re excited about it.”
The contents of the bill will likely shed light on who holds sway in the ever-expanding universe of crypto lobbying. It’s already been the source of clashes between the industry’s growing set of trade associations backed by competing digital asset startups. Aides from both lawmakers’ offices say they’ve been swamped by incoming suggestions on how to approach everything from crypto exchange regulations to tax policy.
It’s one of several crypto bills that lawmakers have begun to draft as companies jockey for influence.
“It’s hard to pay attention to things that are abstract and, for most members of Congress, this has been abstract for a long time,” Lummis, who’s owned Bitcoin since 2013, told the crowd at the Bitcoin Miami conference earlier this year. “That has changed dramatically in the last 12 months — and part of that’s thanks to you all.”
Crypto skeptics warn that the frenzy around the bill is part of an intensifying push by crypto firms to convince lawmakers to shield them from regulations that apply to traditional finance.
Both senators are vying to make their respective states hubs for a blockchain-based economy. State lawmakers in Wyoming have charted an aggressive course in crafting new laws to accommodate crypto banks and decentralized trading platforms. In the Empire State, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has sought to attract digital asset businesses by investing his early paychecks in bitcoin and ether.
“New York is the center of world financial markets,” Gillibrand said at a POLITICO Live event with Lummis earlier this year. “This is one of the greatest growing industries that New York definitely wants to have a part of.”
A leaked draft of the bill, which Lummis said dates from before Gillibrand announced her involvement, set off alarm bells with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. The group’s director of financial regulation and corporate governance, Todd Phillips, said that it would have created new avenues for token-based startups to skirt securities laws and have allowed investors to duck taxes on crypto transactions where they gross less than $600. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly argued that most digital assets likely fall under his agency’s jurisdiction, putting him at odds with industry executives who want to steer clear of the agency.
“The challenge with creating any legislation on digital assets is, most if not everything is covered by existing law. The question then becomes, what are you trying to get by drafting this new legislation?” said Ty Gellasch, a former SEC official who is executive director of the investor advocacy group Healthy Markets. “The industry effort doesn’t seem focused on getting clarity, but rather getting loopholes.”
The bill’s planned release on Tuesday is likely to set off clashes between industry groups, crypto watchdogs and academics over the details. In addition to new rules for trading platforms and crypto service providers, the bill is also expected to cover issues relating to cybersecurity, banking regulation, investor protection standards and stablecoins.
Kara Calvert, the head of U.S. policy at the publicly-traded crypto exchange Coinbase, described both Gillibrand and Lummis as having an “open door” policy when it came to taking feedback on specifics. She said it put the congressional staff tasked with writing the bill in a position where they’re “balancing what their bosses want and what they’re getting from stakeholders.”
An earlier draft of the bill included language that would have established self-regulatory organizations for the industry — a proposal sought by the Association of Digital Asset Markets (ADAM) but flagged as potentially cumbersome by the Blockchain Association. ADAM is backed by FTX, a crypto exchange led by political mega-donor Sam Bankman-Fried. The Blockchain Association’s members include trading platforms Crypto.com and Kraken.
“[Lummis and Gillibrand] want to make sure that they are getting things right from an industry standpoint and also from a consumer protection standpoint,” ADAM CEO Michelle Bond said in an interview. “I just don’t know where this will ultimately shake out.”
In public appearances, the two lawmakers have sketched out the broad contours the bill’s policy aims. They want to exempt Bitcoin miners from rules covering financial brokerage firms and give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — a smaller sister agency to the SEC that polices financial derivatives markets — more authority to oversee crypto markets.
The specifics of those provisions will matter just as much as topline description.
Jennings, with Andreessen Horowitz, said he expects industry players to be disappointed by how much leeway the bill could give the SEC to decide whether certain digital assets are securities. Crypto executives have criticized the agency’s leadership for its tough approach to digital currency trading.
Hill staffers who’ve worked on the bill said both the SEC and CFTC have weighed in.
Crypto attorney Lewis Cohen — who advised Lummis staff on the bill — said it was a near-impossible task to balance the concerns of industry bigwigs and regulators.
“Reflexively treating all tokens as securities, I really do believe it’s both wrong legally and fundamentally bad policy for the U.S.,” said Cohen, co-founder of the firm DLx Law. “But just ignoring the SEC’s concerns is wrong legally and bad for the U.S.”
Lobbying efforts will likely accelerate and expand in the coming months. At a recent industry conference in Washington, Lummis and Gillibrand said as many as four Senate committees would have jurisdiction over their legislation, if it ever came to a vote.
“This is going to be a big focus of debate,” Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith said in an interview. “If this is a needle that can be threaded, then [it’s] going to be a really pivotal moment in the ecosystem.”

The amount of Bitcoin transferred from mining companies to crypto exchanges has hit its highest levels since February.
Miners Under Pressure
Bitcoin miners appear to be capitulating.
Several metrics suggest Bitcoin mining companies are selling their coins to cover costs as the crypto market downturn continues. According to crypto data platform Coin Metrics, the value of Bitcoin earned by miners and sent to exchanges almost doubled in May to a local high of approximately $400 million. The recent increase marks the highest level of miner outflows to exchanges in over three months.
Increased outflows often indicate that miners are moving their coins to exchanges in order to sell them, but are not a direct measure of miners selling. Instead, miners could be transferring their Bitcoin to exchanges for other purposes, such as borrowing against them to cover operating costs.
However, financial disclosures from individual mining companies appear to support the idea that miners are indeed selling. Cathedra Bitcoin recently released its Q1 2022 financial results, revealing that the company had sold $8.7 million worth of Bitcoin in May to insulate itself from further price declines. One of the world’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners, Riot Blockchain, also reported selling half its April production, totaling $9.4 million.
Another issue weighing on Bitcoin miners is decreased profitability. According to data from BitInfoCharts, the mining profitability ratio has plunged since the start of the year, dropping by around 50%. As miners now make less from their operations, it could be forcing companies to eat into their reserves to cover costs.
While miner profitability has dropped, it appears that the Bitcoin total network hash rate is also starting to decline. This metric has since cooled off after peaking at 251.8 Exahash at the beginning of May to just over 218.5 Exahash at press time. A decline in hash rate usually results in a drop in mining difficulty after the next bi-monthly adjustment. This will make mining blocks on the Bitcoin network slightly easier and provide a small windfall for miners who can keep their mining operations running profitably.
To add to the bad news for crypto miners, the New York State Senate recently passed a two-year moratorium on Bitcoin mining operations. This means that any mining operation not running solely on renewable energy will be forced to turn off its machines or relocate until 2024. Current estimates suggest that New York hosts around one-fifth of the U.S.’s total Bitcoin mining hash rate.
Despite mounting regulatory and market pressures, the Bitcoin mining industry remains focused on the longer-term outlook. In April, Electric car manufacturer Tesla teamed up with Blockstream to build a solar array to mine Bitcoin. Elsewhere, ExxonMobil Corp., the largest oil producer in the United States, is piloting a program to use oil well flare gas to power Proof-of-Work mining.
While many individual Bitcoin mining companies have been forced to sell their coins, the industry as a whole appears to be growing as fast as ever. However, the situation could quickly change if the current market slump drags on further.

Currently, Bitcoin is changing hands at $31,289, up 5.2% over the day, according to data provided by CoinMarketCap.
The leading cryptocurrency last traded at these levels on June 1, when it entered a downward correction that dragged the price of BTC from above $32,000 below $30,000 for the most part of the weekend.
Despite the latest spike, Bitcoin is still down more than 34% since the start of the year, with the Fear & Greed Index—a combination of variables measuring market sentiment—currently standing at 13, which corresponds to “extreme fear.”
Ethereum follows the pattern
The price of Ethereum has meanwhile just hit an intraday high of $1,889, as it went up almost 6%, per CoinMarketCap.
The second-largest cryptocurrency still faces a massive uphill battle to recover from the losses since the start of the year when it traded above $3,800.
Ethereum's lackluster price action is compounded by a massive sell-off in the DeFi space. Over the last month, investors withdrew more than $40 billion from ETH-based apps, shrinking the total value locked (TVL) from over $113 billion on May 5 to $71.04 billion as of today, according to data from DeFi Llama.
Elsewhere, major layer 1-networks Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) both posted double-digit gains over the past 24 hours as their tokens rallied 13% and 11.4%, respectively."

Victims have lost over $1 billion in cryptocurrency scams between January 2021 and March 2022 according to a report released by the Federal Trade Commission on Friday.
Over 46,000 people have lost money in crypto fraud since the beginning of 2021 making it the leading source of payment scams. Bitcoin made up 70% of crypto-related scams followed by tether at 10% and Ethereum at 9%.
The report comes at a time of increasingly widespread reports of crypto fraud, and the collapse of the crypto market as a result of regulated offerings.
“Nearly half the people who reported losing crypto to a scam since 2021 said it started with an ad, post, or message on a social media platform,” according to the report.
Further, nearly four out of every ten dollars stolen originated from social media. Meta-owned Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp led the way originating 32%, 26% and 9% of all the fraud in the report, respectively. Telegram came in at 7%.
Fake investments were by far the largest type of fraud that started on social media with $575 million being reported to the FTC during the time period. This type of scam allegedly starts with a promise of huge returns for investors and preying on people’s limited understanding of cryptocurrency.
Romance scams came in second to investment fraud with $185 million reported in losses since 2021. According to the FBI, romance scams occur when a criminal creates a fake online identity to gain a victim’s affection and trust then proceeds to manipulate and steal from the victim. Crypto scams reached an all-time high last year of $14 billion, according to a Chainalysis report, but that’s only 0.15% of the total crypto transactions.
Unlike traditional banks, there’s no formal way to flag suspicious activity and it’s only possible to reverse transactions with a private-key that’s difficult to acquire. This paired with people’s limited knowledge of cryptocurrency results in many people being scammed daily. The rising incidence of fraud has triggered renewed interest in stricter regulation."

The bearish predictions for Bitcoin had repercussions. Some crypto exchanges have taken measures to prepare for the crypto winter.
Gemini and Coinbase Halt Recruitments
Gemini Trust Co., a popular crypto exchange owned by 2 brothers (twins), Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss announced the company will cut 10% of its workforce:
""We are now, in the contraction phase that is settling into a period of stasis, what our industry refers to as 'crypto winter'. This has all been compounded by the current macroeconomic and geopolitical turmoil. We are not alone.
""To that end, we have asked team leaders to ensure that they are focused only on products that are critical to our mission and assess whether their teams are right-sized for the current turbulent market conditions that are likely to persist for some time.
""After much thought and consideration, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to part ways with approximately 10% of our workforce.""

Coinbase initially slowed the pace of hiring new employees but then announced it is pausing hiring ""for both new and backfill roles for the foreseeable future.""
""In response to the current market conditions and ongoing business prioritization efforts, we will extend our hiring pause for both new and backfill roles for the foreseeable future and rescind a number of accepted offers.
""Two weeks ago, we paused hiring while we took time to reprioritize our hiring needs against our highest-priority business goals. As these discussions have evolved, it’s become evident that we need to take more stringent measures to slow our headcount growth.
""Adapting quickly and acting now will help us to successfully navigate this macro environment and emerge even stronger, enabling further healthy growth and innovation.""

Bitcoin Miners Began Selling BTC
Bitcoin miners that have been accumulating Bitcoin rewards are becoming increasingly concerned. Bitcoin's current levels are adding pressure on the crypto miners to liquidate their holdings to cover future operative costs.
source: hashrate index
The crypto mining stock index has a 0.97 correlation to BTC price. Due to the fairly rapid decline in Bitcoin, some miners have already begun liquidating.
Cathedra, a Canadian mining firm revealed in its earnings report that it has sold almost all of its Bitcoin holdings. 235 bitcoins were sold throughout may at an average price of $29,152 for over $5 million:
""Throughout May 2022, the Company sold 235 bitcoin at an average price of $37,315 (US$29,152) for total cash proceeds of $8,768,922. With these sales, the Company insulates itself from additional declines in the price of bitcoin and maintains its liquidity position.
""Cathedra will continue pursuing its long-term goal of accumulating a large bitcoin treasury through its mining operations. As of May 27, 2022, the Company held $2,559,236 in cash and $133,468 of bitcoin (3.69 BTC) for a total of $2,692,704 in cash and bitcoin.""
Cathedra's Chief Executive Officer, AJ Scalia commented the following on the BTC liquidations: ""We have spent the last several weeks restructuring our balance sheet and operations to ensure Cathedra is well-positioned to endure a prolonged economic downturn.""
“Some of these decisions were difficult, but we are confident they are in the long-term best interest of shareholders and the Company.”
Catherdra Official Statement
BTC flow from miners to exchanges spiked in May as seen from the chart below.
source: cryptoquant
Over 2,000 BTC were liquidated on 12 May according to cryptoquant which is tracking over 15 miners. According to Bloomberg, crypto miners transferred 195,663 coins to exchanges in May 2022. It is the largest monthly increase since January.
The estimated value of the cryptocurrencies that were transferred is $6.3 billion. It is important to note that miners may transfer coins to exchanges for other purposes rather than selling.
Riot Blockchain mining company also liquidated bitcoin in May 2022. The firm reported that out of the 466 BTC it has earned in May, 250 BTC were sold for approximately $7.5 million.
Riot Blockchain is holding around 6,536 BTC as of 31 May.
Although there has been a negative downturn for bitcoin, Riot is in the process of constructing a new 1-gigawatt mining facility in Texas. According to the official statement, ""The Expansion has begun with the development of an initial 400 megawatts ('MW') of capacity on a 265-acre site, with immersion-cooled mining and hosting operations expected to commence in July 2023.""
Jason Les, the CEO of Riot said that: ""Upon completion of the Expansion, Riot’s developed capacity will total 1.7 GW, establishing the Company among the largest Bitcoin mining operations globally.""
The Fed Balance Sheet
The Federal Reserve (Fed) may begin reducing its balance sheet as early as June 2022. The impact of the monetary policy tightening is likely to affect multiple markets including cryptocurrencies.
The Fed's balance sheet currently stands at $8.9 trillion.
Focus will be on the 4 US treasury securities the Fed is holding that are maturing in June 2022, starting on 15 June.
15 June: $14.9 billion
30 June: $13.3 billion
30 June: $15.4 billion
30 June: $4.6 billion
Total: $48.5 billion
Rate hikes are expected to be made as the tightening begins. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said it is still unclear what impact will the balance sheet reduction have.
An Economic Hurricane Is Coming
The Federal Reserve is taking these measures to curb inflation, which is at its highest point in 4 decades.
JPMorgan Chief Executive, Jamie Dimon warned that an economic hurricane is coming:
“You know, I said there’s storm clouds but I’m going to change it … it’s a hurricane. Right now, it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this. That hurricane is right out there, down the road, coming our way.
“You’d better brace yourself, JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we’re going to be very conservative with our balance sheet.”
“We’ve never had QT like this, so you’re looking at something you could be writing history books on for 50 years. Central banks don’t have a choice because there’s too much liquidity in the system.
""They have to remove some of the liquidity to stop the speculation, reduce home prices and stuff like that.”
The US inflation soared in recent months, which is forcing central banks to act.

The upcoming monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve may have a significant impact on Bitcoin and the leading cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin May 'Lose Its Peg' to US Indices
BTC has been strongly correlated to the US Indices, such as S&P500 or Nasdaq100. The balance sheet reduction to curb inflation in tandem with rate hikes may cause Bitcoin to 'de-peg' from US markets.
While it is challenging to determine, I am not expecting a reversed correlation. Instead, Bitcoin demonstrates greater resilience in an event of a bearish stock market and benefits from moderate gains based on its own fundamentals, such as regulations, legal tender status etc.
The Fed monetary policy may inject greater volatility in Bitcoin in the short-term, in the medium to long term the price may be sustained by market bulls.
When central banks loosed their monetary policies due to the 2008 financial crisis the currency correlations were altered. Likewise, when Yellen began tightening the currency correlations were changed once again.
A similar phenomenon may occur with Bitcoin.
Reports that Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments, and Charles Schab Corp are developing a crypto trading system for retail brokers may only strengthen the crypto markets.
Joined by Virtu Financial Inc, the financial firms' platform will offer brokers crypto executions to their clients. The ecosystem is still being developed and many are only available at the beginning of 2023.
Sequoia Capital and Paradigm may also join the project.
Crypto Algos Potential Impact
The abrupt shift in market conditions may be sufficient to achieve the above. While the Fed will strive to accelerate its balance sheet reduction, breaking out of the correlation may take some time.
The Fed monetary policy that is due next week (15 June) may mark the beginning of new market fundamentals for Bitcoin. As other cryptocurrencies and tokens often trade in tandem with Bitcoin, crypto trading algorithms' performance may be affected.
On most occasions when market conditions abruptly change, algorithms tend to post negative results.
$32,500 (approx.) may be the key daily resistance in BTCUSD. A firm daily close above may clear the way for further gains."

Published June 8, 2022 Updated June 8, 2022 Cryptocurrencies have gone from a curiosity to a sizable force in finance, technology and culture, making them almost impossible to ignore. A range of players have embraced crypto, from individual speculators to major financial institutions, despite how volatile they are.. Some have generated vast riches, while others have destroyed huge amounts of wealth. When people talk about crypto, they may be referring to one of many different ideas and companies. The industry is booming and spawning an abundance of projects and new terms to go with them. The topic can be confusing, but the concept has also become ubiquitous. Learning the right terminology can help.
What is a Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. A Bitcoin can be divided out to eight decimal places, so you can send someone 0.00000001 Bitcoin. This smallest fraction of a Bitcoin — the penny of the Bitcoin world — is referred to as a Satoshi, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which this form of digital currency is stored and moved. Unlike traditional payment networks such as Visa, the Bitcoin network is not run by a single company or person. The system is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions, similar to the way Wikipedia is maintained by a decentralized network of writers and editors. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a creator who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who communicated with the rest of the world only by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as possibly being Satoshi, the identity of the real Satoshi has not been confirmed. Satoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then shared the software with the rest of the world in 2009. The inventor largely disappeared from the public two years later. Once Satoshi had released the software, anyone could download and use it. This means Satoshi has no more control over the network now than anyone else.
What is Bitcoin mining? Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new Bitcoins are created and given to computers helping to maintain the network. The computers involved in Bitcoin mining are in a sort of computational race to process new transactions coming onto the network, solving complex math problems that require quintillions of numerical guesses per second. The winner of that race — generally the person with the fastest computers — gets a chunk of new Bitcoins. Since miners can earn rewards but are independent, this process is meant to incentivize participation and maintenance. There is generally a new winner about every 10 minutes, and this will continue until there are 21 million Bitcoins in the world. At that point, no new Bitcoins will be created. The network is expected to reach that cap in 2140. Every Bitcoin in existence was created through this method and initially given to a computer helping to maintain the records. In Bitcoin’s early years, a crypto enthusiast could mine coins by running software on a laptop. But as the digital assets have become more popular, the amount of power necessary to win the race and generate Bitcoins has soared. A single Bitcoin transaction now requires more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, or enough energy to sustain the average U.S. household for 73 days, according to some estimates.

What is a blockchain? blockchain is a database that is maintained communally and that reliably stores digital information The original blockchain was the database on which all Bitcoin transactions were stored. It was named “blockchain” because the transactions coming onto the network were grouped into blocks of data and then chained together using sophisticated math. After the Bitcoin blockchain had operated for a number of years, successfully storing every Bitcoin transaction and surviving numerous attacks from hackers, many programmers and entrepreneurs wondered if its design could be replicated to create other kinds of secure ledgers unrelated to Bitcoin. Companies and governments that don’t rely on currency have since begun using blockchain technology to store their data. Banks are building blockchains that can track payments between accounts, while governments are experimenting with using blockchains to store property records and votes.
What is Coinbase? Coinbase is a platform that allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies , including Bitcoin, for a transaction fee. It is similar to a stock exchange. Founded in San Francisco in 2012, Coinbase allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies, including Bitcoin. In April 2021, Coinbase became the first major cryptocurrency company to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange. Coinbase set itself apart from other early blockchain businesses by becoming one of the first to get a new special license, called the BitLicense, to run a virtual currency company in New York. In addition to providing the brokerage service for small investors, Coinbase also runs an exchange called GDAX, which is tailored to larger investors.
What are cryptocurrencies? “Cryptocurrencies” is a term referring to the various virtual currencies that have been developed since Bitcoin was created The most well-known cryptocurrencies are Ether, Dogecoin and Tether. Ether is the virtual currency used on the global computing network Ethereum, which operates according to rules defined by Ethereum software. Those rules allow the Ethereum network to be programmed to complete certain types of computing tasks, with every computer on the network completing the tasks simultaneously to ensure they are done correctly. Generally, the tasks involve money. The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has likened the network to a global smartphone that can be programmed to operate according to the apps built on top of it. The apps are called Dapps because they are run by a decentralized network of computers. Mr. Buterin was inspired by Bitcoin’s success to create Ethereum. But he set out to build something that could do more than Bitcoin: He wanted to build a system that would make it possible to program more complex financial transactions. With Ethereum, two companies can conduct transactions, such as settling a stock option on a shared computer, that allows them both to check the records. Dogecoin was created as a parody of cryptocurrency in 2013 by two friends who had met in a chat room. Named after a meme of an expressive dog, Dogecoin was meant to mock the self-serious cryptocurrencies of the time, many of which never took off. The joke did, though, and it spawned a community of enthusiasts who have kept it alive for years. Tether is the largest stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that is typically pegged to an existing government-backed currency. It is roughly half-invested in a type of short-term corporate debt called commercial paper. Show more
What is DeFi? Decentralized Finance, or DeFi , refers to the universe of alternative financial services spawned by the development of cryptocurrencies. DeFi is an umbrella term for the part of the crypto universe that is geared toward building a new, internet-native financial system, using blockchains to replace traditional intermediaries like banks and trust mechanisms. It has allowed crypto businesses to move into more traditional banking territory, offering services such as lending and borrowing. Investors can earn interest on their holdings of digital currencies — often a lot more than they could on cash deposits in a bank — or borrow with crypto as collateral to back a loan. Crypto loans generally involve no credit checks since transactions are backed by digital assets. To send or receive money in the traditional financial system, you need intermediaries like banks or stock exchanges. In DeFi, those middlemen are replaced by software. As people trade directly with one another, blockchain-based “smart contracts” do the work of making markets, settling trades and ensuring that the entire process is fair and trustworthy.

What is an NFT? nonfungible token, or NFT, is a digital asset that establishes authenticity and ownership and can be verified on a blockchain network. An NFT is basically a way to claim ownership of a digital file: You can think of it as a certificate of authenticity you might get if you buy an expensive sculpture. The sculpture can be copied, forged or even stolen, but because you have the certificate of authenticity, you can theoretically prove that you are the owner of the original. NFTs make digital artworks unique and, therefore, sellable. Artists, musicians, influencers and sports franchises can use them to monetize digital goods that were previously cheap or free. The technology also responds to the art world’s need for authentication and provenance in an increasingly digital world, permanently linking a digital file to its creator. The technology for NFTs has been around since the mid-2010s but became mainstream in late 2017 with CryptoKitties, a site that allowed people to buy and “breed” limited-edition digital cats with cryptocurrency. Since then, investors have begun buying and trading NFTs, often for eye-popping prices.
What is a stablecoin? stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is typically pegged to a stable asset, like the dollar or another government-backed currency. To promise holders that every $1 they put in will remain worth $1, stablecoin issuers hold a bundle of assets in reserve, usually short-term securities such as cash, government debt or commercial paper. Stablecoins are useful because they help lock in value at the time of transaction. This is important since cryptocurrencies are volatile and prone to price fluctuations. They form a bridge between traditional money and crypto, and are exploding in popularity as a practical and cheap way to make transactions in cryptocurrency. But many stablecoins are built more like slightly risky investments than like the dollars-and-cents cash they claim to be. And, so far, they are slipping through regulatory cracks. Regulators are concerned about stablecoins because they have exploded in popularity very quickly, and because many are backed by traditional reserves, they could and trigger a kind of bank run that would potentially pose risks in the wider financial system. There is also no consistent oversight of issuers or a standard for reserves, and as such different stablecoin issuers have different types of reserve backing, including more or less cash, treasuries, commercial paper, etc. There are a few kinds of stablecoins, including these digital assets backed by traditional reserves, others are collateralized by crypto and, finally, algorithmic stablecoins. The risk in algorithmic stablecoins — which depend on a mathematical formula devised by issuers and investor interest to maintain stability — was demonstrated in May when Terra/Luna crashed after the assumptions the algorithm was premised on did not pan out in the market and investors fled.

What is web3? Web3 ” is a term some technologists use to describe the idea of a new version of the web made up of blockchain-based platforms and services fueled by cryptocurrency. At its core, web3 aims to replace centralized corporate platforms with open protocols and decentralized, community-run networks. The term has been around for years, but it has become trendy in the past year or so. Packy McCormick, an investor who helped popularize web3, has defined it as “the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.” Web3 is seen as the next evolution of web1 (the era in the 1990s and early 2000s during which the internet was made up of blogs, message boards and early portals like AOL and CompuServe) and web2 (a phase starting around 2005 or so, characterized by social media behemoths like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube). Proponents envision that web3 will take many forms, including decentralized social networks, “play-to-earn” video games that reward players with crypto tokens, and NFT platforms that allow people to buy and sell pieces of digital culture. The more idealistic ones say web3 will transform the internet as we know it, upending traditional gatekeepers and ushering in a new, middleman-free digital economy. But some critics believe that web3 is little more than a rebranding effort for crypto, with the aim of shedding crypto’s reputation as a place for rogues and rebels and convincing people that blockchains are the next phase of computing. Others believe it’s a dystopian vision of a pay-to-play internet in which every activity and social interaction becomes a financial instrument to be bought and sold."
462,2022-06-08,2022-06-08,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Kanav Jain,ambcrypto.com,Bitcoin: Bull run or a bear halt? Here's what crypto analysts are suggesting,Major analysts across the crypto industry are predicting a bear run for Bitcoin after a recent price surge.,https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-bull-run-or-a-bear-halt-heres-what-crypto-analysts-are-suggesting/,"Major analysts across the crypto industry are predicting a bear run for Bitcoin [BTC] despite a recent price surge. Furthermore, a majority of the population holding the token is also reporting a negative sentiment over the prized BTC.
The question is- What has led to this negative sentiment and what has been stated about the future of the king token?
Let’s find out
As per a retweet by Santiment, the weighted sentiment metric is pointing towards an extremely bearish run for Bitcoin. The observation suggests a largely negative sentiment of BTC holders in the market. However, this can also lead to unexpected “upside swings” with a high leverage ratio and an over-average negative funding rate.
Beware of the bears
A pseudonymous crypto analyst on Twitter predicted a new low for Bitcoin in 2022. He, later on, added, “whether you like it or not, capitulation is likely.” Given the current market situation, the analyst stated,
“Clean range. What is happening inside the range and what has happened at the range high, shows that this is clear redistribution range. Clean break of the range low = last leg down confirmed = 21k-23k,”
This comes as a big blow to crypto supporters as Bitcoin finally broke through the $31,000 cap recently and consolidated around $30,500. Furthermore, BTC has also shown signs of recovery after massive falls that captured the market in May.
Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed index is currently at 17 indicating a period of “Extreme Fear” for the community. Despite bearish remarks by analysts, Bitcoin has recovered well recently after a calamitous May. It is currently up by 2.5% in the past day, standing at $30,200. There is also an activity surge on the Bitcoin network with volume up by 13% at $40 billion.
Amidst all the bearish chaos, a group of activists from the Human Right Foundation wrote a letter to Congress defending Bitcoin against critics of cryptocurrencies. As per Alexandria, earlier this week, a number of skeptics submitted an open letter to top U.S. politicians- and described cryptocurrencies as “risky, flawed and unproven.”
Rejecting the notion that BTC is a solution “in search of problems,” they produced examples of where this digital asset has changed lives for the better — and included links to reputable news outlets as further evidence.
“We can personally attest — as do the enclosed reports from top global media outlets — that when currency catastrophes struck Cuba, Afghanistan, and Venezuela, Bitcoin gave our compatriots refuge. When crackdowns on civil liberties befell Nigeria, Belarus, and Hong Kong, Bitcoin helped keep the fight against authoritarianism afloat.”"

According to on-chain analytics resource Whalemap, Bitcoin whales have all but dictated market performance in recent weeks.
Whales help pin Bitcoin at $30,000
In a fresh analysis published on June 7, Whalemap researchers showed that BTC/USD local tops and bottoms have coincided with areas of heightened whale activity.
When Bitcoin’s largest wallet entities choose to buy or sell, the price reacts accordingly. For those looking to reduce risk trading short timeframes, it may thus suffice to act according to where popular whale levels lie.
“Can it get easier than this?” Whalemap summarized in part of a Twitter post.

As Cointelegraph reported, some whales are of more interest than others. Over the past week, one such entity on Binance has been contributing to Bitcoin’s narrow trading range with a series of buys and sells.
“This binance whale has marked every local top/bottom for the last two weeks,” popular analyst Credible Crypto added in new Twitter comments on June 8.
“Been watching him come and go. Accumulating at the lows, capping price at the highs. Most recently filled 2,000 BTC (60 million) at the local lows at 29.2k before this pump we are seeing now.”
That “pump,” just like that from earlier in the week, has been short-lived, with BTC/USD plateauing then reversing, losing practically all the gains from its initial uptrend, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.

“Annoying” stocks correlation keeps pressure on BTC
Zooming out beyond internal factors, meanwhile, optimism remains thin for inflationary macro conditions favoring crypto strength going forward.

Stocks themselves are further unlikely to feel relief in the short term, commentator Bob Loukas admitted on June 7 as monetary tightening worldwide gathers pace.
“Still don’t see macro catalyst (yet) for bottom in equities. As stated before has look of a cyclical bear market that needs more time,” he said.
“Price action on Cycle front confirms, move down into summer months. Been underweight a while, happy to be wrong. Wont fomo a ripping rally.”

In an interview with CNBC on June 9, Tom Lee, co-founder of independent research firm Fundstrat, revealed that he was unsure if BTC/USD would end the year above its starting price.
Lee suggests market has “already bottomed”
Bitcoin price projections for 2022 have plummeted as macro pressures combine with black swan events such as the Terra implosion to send sentiment to near record lows.
While many argue that a capitulation event will enter in the coming months to send BTC/USD to $20,000 or under, Lee believes that underlying strength is worth paying attention to now.
“It’s a risk-on asset, so I think to the extent that Nasdaq and Bitcoin rally, it’s helping us become more comfortable that the market’s already bottomed,” he told CNBC’s CB Overtime segment.
At the same time, Lee brushed off the Terra debacle and redundancies at major crypto companies including United States exchange Coinbase, saying that Bitcoin was “acting far better than people expect.”
When asked where BTC price action was headed by the start of 2023 — even if correlated stock markets put in gains — the response was less optimistic.
“I think Bitcoin’s going to make its way to flat for the year, possibly up,” he concluded.
Lee was previously famous for his bullish takes on Bitcoin, among which was a prediction of $200,000 for 2022 made shortly after the latest all-time high of $69,000 last November.
Saylor on BTC: “If it’s not going to zero, it’s going to a million”
Meanwhile, unapologetically bullish was MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, whose own comments to mainstream media firmly brushed aside any suggestion of permanent price downside.
Related: BTC price gains 4% pre-Fed as MicroStrategy vows to protect Bitcoin from $21K crash
Those who claimed that Bitcoin would be banned or go to zero, he told CNBC on June 8, had already been “discredited.”
“If the deniers are wrong and the skeptics are wrong — and it’s pretty obvious they’re both wrong at this point — it’s not going to zero, and if it’s not going to zero, it’s going to a million,” Saylor forecast.
While nothing new, Saylor being “very bullish on where we go from here” increasingly grates with the downbeat perspective on risk assets across the board in the new era of central bank monetary tightening.
As Cointelegraph recently reported, some believe that it will take until the next block subsidy halving in 2024 for a meaningful price recovery to enter.
Saylor, meanwhile, said that when it comes to buying more BTC for its existing reserves, there was no point in “timing the market.”
“We’re kind of doing the equivalent of dollar cost averaging for a large corporation,” he explained:
“We’re not trying to time the market; I think all the statistics on the S&P and on the Bitcoin index show you can’t time the market. We’re just reinvesting free cash flows in the market as circumstances allow us.”
BTC/USD traded at around $30,500 at the time of writing on June 9, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.

Meanwhile, this past Tuesday Republican Cynthia Lummis and Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand introduced what many call a “landmark” crypto bill. Named the Responsible Financial Innovations Act, the bipartisan legislation aims to finally clear up the biggest regulatory questions hanging over digital assets.
“The bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act is a landmark bill that will establish a regulatory framework that spurs innovation, develops clear standards, defines appropriate jurisdictional boundaries and protects consumers. Importantly, the Lummis-Gillibrand framework will provide clarity to both industry and regulators, while also maintaining the flexibility to account for the ongoing evolution of the digital assets market,” said Senator Gillibrand

Zooming out
Here’s a run-through of some of the key provisions in the legislation.
The Responsible Financial Innovation Act seeks to classify digital assets into securities and commodities and regulate them accordingly. This will “give digital asset companies the ability to determine what their regulatory obligations will be and give regulators the clarity they need to enforce existing securities and commodities trading laws.” For example, bitcoin and ether, which fall into the “commodity” bucket, would be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
The bill would lighten the tax burden for crypto holders and miners. Small purchases of up to $200 would no longer have to be reported to the IRS, which would make transacting in crypto easier. It also “declassifies” miners as brokers seeking to exempt their holdings from taxation until “redeemed for cash.”
On the anti-crypto side, Lummis and Gillibrand want to eradicate algorithmic stablecoins that aren’t backed by “TradFi” assets, such as gold or fiat currencies. “Lummis-Gillibrand establishes 100% reserve, asset type and detailed disclosure requirements for all payment stablecoin issuers. This guarantees that a payment stablecoin holder can always redeem the stablecoin in exchange for the equivalent dollar value, which maintains its value and protects consumers from many of the potential risks associated with stablecoins,” the bill press release stated.
Looking ahead
The Responsible Financial Innovation Act is a landmark, yet very early, step in building a clear regulatory framework for crypto. The bill will have to pass a number of Senate hearings before it can be brought up for a full vote.
Political experts, therefore, believe it has zero chance of going anywhere before the end of this year. And given its scope, there’s a high possibility that it will be heavily massaged or split into smaller bills.
Still, this bipartisan effort is shaping up to be the most sweeping—and largely pro-crypto—legislation to date, which is crucial for the mainstream adoption of digital assets and their integration into traditional finance.
As Diogo Monica, the co-founder of institutional digital asset platform Anchorage, said in an interview with CNBC, “What is bad for crypto is no regulation and enforcement, and any kind of regulation, even strict, is welcome by the industry.

BTC difficulty
The Bitcoin mining difficulty is the estimated number of hashes that is required to mine a block.
Sponsored
Sponsored
The difficulty has been increasing rapidly since Aug and reached a new all-time high on May 23.
Despite the ongoing market correction, the difficulty is still close to its all-time high levels.
Difficulty ribbon compression
The difficulty ribbon is an on-chain indicator that uses moving averages (MA) of Bitcoin mining difficulty. The difficulty ribbon compression adds a standard deviation to this indicator. Historically, values between 0.01 and 0.05 (highlighted in green) have indicated bottoms.
BTC crossed below the 0.05 threshold in the beginning of May and is currently at 0.045. While the low is inside the bottom area, previous bottoms have usually been reached closer to 0.02.
More specifically, the 2015 bottom was reached at 0.024, the 2018 bottom was reached at 0.019 and the 2020 one at 0.020.
As a result, BTC has more room to fall according to the difficulty ribbon compression.
Hash ribbon
Unlike the BTC difficulty, which is calculated every two weeks, the hash rate is calculated every day.
The has ribbon indicator shows if miners have capitulated by using the hash rate. Miners capitulate when their mining costs are higher than the rewards.
In the chart, this is shown visually when the 30-day moving average (MA) crosses below the 60-day (blue). Afterwards, this created a light red area, which turns to dark red when there is a bullish cross.
Historically, such crosses have preceded significant upward movements.
A closer look at the movement shows that a bearish cross occurred on June 7.
So, if previous history is followed, miner capitulation is already starting to occur and a BTC bottom will follow soon.

In the years following bitcoin’s creation, the price of a single bitcoin has increased exponentially, from essentially zero to an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in October 2021, cementing its legacy as one of the greatest investment opportunities in history. The rise of bitcoin has spawned explosive growth in the burgeoning cryptocurrency and digital asset industry, which remains largely unregulated both here in the United States and globally.
Enter Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who on June 7, 2022, released their much anticipated bill designed to resolve a number of critical issues facing the cryptocurrency industry. In this article, we will examine some of the key provisions of the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act (hereinafter “Lummis-Gillibrand” or the “Act”).
First, Lummis-Gillibrand includes a number of definitions for key terms such as digital asset, virtual currency, payment stablecoin, smart contract, and distributed ledger technology (a/k/a blockchain). If codified into law, these definitions alone would go a long way towards establishing a framework for understanding some admittedly complex concepts.
Next, in an obvious effort to encourage greater adoption and use of cryptocurrency as an alternative form of payment and exchange of value, Lummis-Gillibrand provides an exclusion of up to $200 per transaction (subject to an aggregation rule) from a taxpayer’s gross income for use of cryptocurrency for payment for goods or services under specified conditions.
With regard to the mining and “staking” of cryptocurrencies (typically for the purpose of earning interest or other rewards on the staked cryptocurrency), Lummis-Gillibrand declares that digital assets obtained from these activities do not form a part of a taxpayer’s gross income until the eventual disposition of those assets and conversion to fiat currency.
Importantly, Lummis-Gillibrand specifies that the default classification for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is as a business entity for purposes of the tax code, and requires most DAOs to be properly incorporated or organized under the laws of an identifiable jurisdiction, whether as a limited liability company (LLC), corporation, partnership, etc. (in basic terms, a DAO is a collective organization designed to be administered and governed without centralized leadership using smart contracts and blockchain technology). Popular DAOs include Uniswap (a decentralized exchange for swapping various forms of cryptocurrency), certain non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
While generally viewed as “friendly” to the crypto industry, Lummis-Gillibrand attempts to strike an important balance between continued innovation, decentralization, and consumer/investor protection. One of the most hotly debated areas has been who should regulate cryptocurrency and other digital assets. In what would be perceived as a major win for the crypto industry if passed into law, Lummis-Gillibrand grants to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) (as opposed to the Securities and Exchange Commission) exclusive spot market jurisdiction over all fungible digital assets which are not securities that could help pave the way for a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Lummis-Gillibrand also requires digital asset exchanges (such as Coinbase, Binance, and Crypto.com) to register with the CFTC in order to conduct trading activities and further classifies those exchanges as financial institutions subject to other existing laws.
Lummis-Gillibrand distinguishes between digital assets that should be treated as commodities versus those that should be treated as securities by codifying existing legal precedent under the Howey test for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an “investment contract” and is therefore, deemed a security subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The determination requires an examination of the rights or powers given to the holder of the digital asset, as well as the asset’s inherent purpose. In order to be classified as a security, the digital asset must provide the holder with a debt or equity interest in a business entity, liquidation rights or entitlement to interest or dividend payments from a business entity, a profit or revenue share in a business entity derived “solely from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,” or any other financial interest in the entity. Notably, Lummis-Gillibrand calls for most digital assets to be treated like commodities in bankruptcy proceedings.
On the other hand, payment stablecoins (a type of cryptocurrency backed by one or more non-digital financial assets and redeemable on a one-to-one basis for instruments denominated in United States dollars), are defined by Lummis-Gillibrand as neither commodities nor securities, but would still be subject to significant regulation under the Act, which regulation is much needed following the recent collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and the reliance on stablecoins in many parts of the developing world as an alternative store of value and a hedge against inflation.
There are many other provisions contained in Lummis-Gillibrand, the full text of which can be easily found online, but the foregoing are some of the highlights.
While Lummis-Gillibrand appears to have bi-partisan support, it will be interesting to see how Congress responds in the coming weeks and months. If nothing else, it is a landmark piece of legislation that will hopefully encourage the responsible growth and development of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets and promote further discussion regarding the need for regulation of this promising new industry."

Senator Lummis, A message from Fidelity. BITCOIN FIRST: Why investors need to consider bitcoin
separately from other digital assetshttps://t.co/uE9ejQPPeW — Bryan Solstin for US Senate (@BryanBSolstin) June 7, 2022
Senator Lummis co-authored the draft bill with Senator Kristen Gillibrand. The bill offered to integrate all crypto-assets into the existing financial system fully. The bill does not distinguish between crypto-assets but suggests implementing a separate organization to manage their implementation.
Candidate Solstin only opposed the part of the bill that considered all crypto assets without distinguishing. According to Solstin, Bitcoin is fundamentally different from all other digital assets and needs special treatment when being incorporated into the financial system.
Why should Bitcoin be different?
Fidelity Investment’s report considers Bitcoin as a monetary good on a trajectory to become the primary money of the future, unlike any other crypto asset.
Bitcoin is the future of money
The report argues that Bitcoin represents a better monetary good than gold or other fiat currencies, which is why it will become the world’s primary currency.
When compared to gold and fiat money, Bitcoin stands out in terms of durability, divisibility, fungibility, mobility, verifiability, and scarcity. Despite its discouraging track record, Bitcoin still seems the best monetary option after a well-rounded comparison.
In addition, the report points out that the Bitcoin network offers the largest, most secure, and most decentralized system when compared to other assets, crypto or otherwise. These vital characteristics significantly affect Bitcoin’s future as the future currency.
Other crypto assets
While acknowledging the strengths of other crypto assets, the report states that none of them have the characteristics to become the currency of the future and that is why they need to be assessed with a different perspective than Bitcoin.
The report states:
“There is not necessarily mutual exclusivity between the success of the Bitcoin network and all other digital asset networks. Rather, the rest of the digital asset ecosystem can fulfill different needs or solve other problems that bitcoin simply does not.”
This is why other assets have
In order to stress this difference and protect investors accordingly, the legal framework should be divided into two: one to examine Bitcoin’s emergence as the future currency, and another to assess the value of other crypto assets, the report states."

Many remain optimistic on future gains.",https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-outlook-for-june-market-conditions-show-uncertainty/,"Bitcoin Price Outlook for June — Market Conditions Show Uncertainty
Ten days into June, bitcoin continues to trade lower, with prices hovering close to a twelve-month low. Despite this, there continues to be optimism around potential rallies in price over the next few weeks. Overall, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the market, with the potential for either bullish or bearish runs in upcoming sessions.
Current Market Conditions
Heading into June, bitcoin (BTC) had seen its value fall for nine consecutive weeks, pushing prices to their lowest level since the same point last year.
This run started towards the end of March, when U.S. inflation rose to nearly 9%, with the war between Russia and Ukraine also escalating.
As a result of these fundamental factors, traders and investors alike began to move away from high-risk assets, opting to find safety in safe havens instead.
Since then crypto markets have continued to decline, with BTC/USD going from $48,257 at the beginning of April, to a low of around $28,000 in the past three weeks.
Following these drops, BTC has continued to consolidate close to this level, moving between $28,000 and $30,500 over the past few weeks.
However, with two-thirds of the month left, traders are interested to see if this trend will continue, or if a rebound in price is possible.
June Outlook
Bitcoin once again fell to its floor of $29,500 this week, as market uncertainty remained rife during the past few sessions.
Despite hitting this support point, bulls will likely be optimistic due to the historical rallies that take place at this point.
As seen from the chart below, on the last two occasions that BTC has traded at this current level in June 2021, and December 2020, there were significant surges in price.
Should history repeat itself, then we will likely see bulls attempting to take prices above the ceiling of $32,500.
From that point onwards, the target will likely be $35,000, which was the second point of interest for the bulls who pushed prices up during those runs in December 2020, and June 2021.
Overall, June looks as though it could potentially birth some surges in BTC’s price, however, a key indicator to pay attention to will be the 14-day RSI.
As of writing, this currently sits at 33.9, which is above support at 33, and should relative strength continue to remain above this floor, then we could see $32,500 sooner than later.

Here’s what several analysts in the market are saying about the outlook for Bitcoin moving forward since there appears to be little relief on the inflation front and the Federal Reserve is still determined to raise interest rates.
Dollar strength weighs heavily on risk assets
The effect of the high CPI print on two benchmarks of financial markets, the dollar index (DXY) and the S&P 500 (SPX), was touched on by il Capo of Crypto, who posted the following charts noting that “After CPI results, #DXY continues its pump and #SPX keeps free-falling.”

Market analyst Kevin Svenson also said that the Fed's inability to curb inflation is likely to translate to choppy price action for the next year.
With inflation, at 8.6% that means increased rate hikes are likely. $DXY is going parabolic. #BTC and most asset classes are likely going to have to deal with lots of ranging at the lows. Sideways for a year possibly.
Instant recovery is not likely. — Kevin Svenson (@KevinSvenson_) June 10, 2022
There's potential for a pullback below $28,000
Should the price of BTC continue to trend lower, crypto trader and pseudonymous Twitter user Altcoin Sherpa says trading below $28,000 is possible.

Insight into what it would take to avoid a pullback to the support at $28,000 was provided by market analyst and pseudonymous Twitter user CrediBULL Crypto, who posted the following chart showing the “unfortunate” retrace from $30,000, the area. The analyst suggested that this “was the moment where we needed to see follow through.”

The latest data shows both narrowing profit margins and miners waiting longer to recoup their initial investment.
Miner production cost faces off with BTC price
While Bitcoin miners have largely held off on major distribution as BTC/USD descends from all-time highs, the picture now appears precarious.
Calculations from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reveal that miners’ production price — how much it costs to mine a single Bitcoin — could be right where the current spot price resides.
While “raw” costs may be around $22,000 per BTC for miners in North America, which is home to the lion’s share of hashing power, additional costs could put the total at more like $30,000.
“We estimate cost basis for bitcoin miners in North America around $22K per bitcoin mined. This estimate includes the direct cost of mining and S&A expenses. It does not include depreciation and amortization charges,” CryptoQuant senior analyst Julio Moreno confirmed to Cointelegraph in private comments:
“If depreciation and amortization charges are included then the cost basis for mining Bitcoin is at around $30K, basically at the same level as current bitcoin price.”

Fears of a “capitulation” event among miners should spot price deteriorate remain a talking point. So far, however, only the May dip below $24,000 saw a noticeable reaction from the mining community.
“Our data shows increasing Bitcoin flows from miners to exchanges during March 2022 and then a sharp spike in flows during the first week of May. This is in line with Bitcoin selling reported by some mining companies in Q1 2022,” Moreno added.

The Index, which shows the current price in United States dollar per terahashes, according to ASIC miner efficiency, confirms that that cost area has been decreasing incrementally since December 2021.
At the same time, findings by Twitter user XBTJames show the time taken for the average participant to enter profit by seeing return on investment (ROI) is expanding.

“Time to ROI has been increasing steadily since the 'China Ban' ASIC firesale last year. While USD pricing on ASICs has come down, the selloff in BTC and the increase in difficulty have combined to severely impact mining profitability,” the account explained in a series of tweets.
XBTJames added that higher BTC prices would be needed to reduce the pain for miners, including new market players and those looking to expand their hashing capabilities.

475,2022-06-11,2022-06-11,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,John Naughton,www.theguardian.com,"As energy prices soar, the bitcoin miners may find they have struck fool’s gold",The rising price of electricity and the plunging value of the cryptocurrency could burst the speculative bubble for today’s prospectors,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/11/as-energy-prices-soar-the-bitcoin-miners-may-find-they-have-struck-fools-gold,"In the bad old days, prospecting for gold was a grisly business involving hysterical crowds, pickaxes, digging, the wearing of appalling hats, standing in rivers panning for nuggets, “staking” claims and so on. The California gold rush of 1848-55, for example, brought 300,000 hopefuls to the Sierra Nevada and northern California and involved the massacre of thousands of Indigenous people.
In our day, the new gold is bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, and prospecting for it has become a genteel armchair activity, although it is called “mining”, for old times’ sake. What it actually involves is using computers to perform unfathomably complicated calculations to create cryptographic “hashes” – codes that are, in practical terms, uncrackable.
Sounds intimidating, doesn’t it? But in reality anyone can play the game. You just have to have the right kit – a special bitcoin-mining computer called an Asic (application-specific integrated circuit). These gizmos are readily available online. I’m looking at one as I write: the Bitmain Antminer S19, which costs $6,999 (£5,600) and can do 95 terahashes – 95tn calculations – every second.
Mining is a misleading term for the computational work that’s needed to validate transactions on the blockchain – the cryptographically protected distributed ledger that underpins bitcoin. For every “block” that a miner is able to validate, they are rewarded with a number (currently 6.3) of new bitcoins. The value of the reward is tied to the prevailing price of the currency at the time. Not so long ago, for example, when each bitcoin stood at $68,000, that reward was worth nearly $430,000.
So you can understand why bitcoin mining looks a bit like a contemporary version of what happened in California in the 1840s. While most of the hopeful arrivals then were Americans, there were also thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia and China. The Judge Business School in Cambridge, which has been tracking bitcoin mining for years, now finds that the US, with 37.84% of global hashrates, remains the biggest location, followed by China (21.11%), Kazakhstan (13.22%), Canada (6.48%) and Russia (4.66%).
So bitcoin mining has become a global phenomenon. And while here and there there are small outfits diversifying into it, such as the Californian pancake-batter maker that bought an Asic after pancake sales plunged during the pandemic, most miners are now industrial-scale operations with large sheds of Asics in serried racks, looking for all the world like small-scale data centres of the kind run by Google and co.
And, like data centres, they are power-hungry. That Bitmain Antminer machine, for example, has a power rating of 3,250 watts. It was recently estimated that bitcoin consumes about 110 terawatt hours per year, which is 0.55% of global electricity production, or roughly equivalent to the annual energy draw of countries such Malaysia or Sweden.
Bitcoin has been a fascinating phenomenon from the beginning, but one that morphed under the pressure of greed
For many operators, bitcoin mining has up to now been an astonishingly lucrative activity, with gross margins sometimes as high as 90%. But suddenly things have changed. First, bitcoin’s price has plunged – from its peak of $68,000 to $30,587 as I write this. And second, electricity prices have soared – by up to 70% in parts of the world, leading some industry experts to calculate that mining a single bitcoin can now cost up to $25,000. So the industry finds itself squeezed at both ends. Just like any ordinary business, in other words.
There’s an agreeable sense of schadenfreude in all this. Bitcoin has been a fascinating phenomenon from the very beginning, but one that morphed under the pressure of greed. Originally conceived as a currency – that is, as a means of payment – it rapidly became perceived as an asset class and, in a time of low interest rates, was the subject of an hysterical speculative bubble that now seems to have deflated, even if it hasn’t definitively burst.
Although it was predictable from the outset that, as the currency evolved, maintenance of its underpinning cryptographic blockchain would become ever-more onerous, it took a long time for the environmental consequences of that fact to be realised. But perhaps that’s a hallmark of every speculative bubble. It’s always difficult to get people to understand something if their wealth – real or anticipated – depends on their not understanding it. Meanwhile, the rest of us are left with the realisation that even the coolest idea can fry the planet.

Key Takeaways Edward Snowden has said that he is ""very much a fan"" of Bitcoin, but he thinks that its lack of privacy could mean it fails in the long term.
The American whistleblower said that there are multiple crypto assets that can be thought of as money akin to gold rather than currencies.
He added that he thinks competition between cryptocurrencies is a net positive for the world.

The American whistleblower has expressed his concerns about the financialization of the crypto space, but added that he sees huge promise in the technology.
Edward Snowden Talks Bitcoin
Edward Snowden says he believes in the crypto movement, but he thinks there are some major hurdles to address over the coming years.
Speaking in a virtual interview at Consensus 2022 in Austin today, the American whistleblower and President of the Freedom of the Press Foundation shared his thoughts on the promise of the emerging technology and issued a clear warning about the dangers of a world devoid of financial privacy with respect to crypto.
Snowden, who made international headlines when he leaked classified National Security Agency documents detailing surveillance practices of U.S. citizens in 2013, described Bitcoin’s public nature as a “core flaw” and said that the biggest reason for why it could fail is because it is not private. “It is failing as an electronic cash system because cash is largely intended to be anonymous,” he said, referencing the Bitcoin whitepaper (Satoshi Nakamoto famously touted Bitcoin as “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.”)
Though he said he saw issues with Bitcoin’s public ledger, Snowden clarified that he was “very much a fan” of the technology and made a comparison between gold and cryptocurrencies, noting that the borderless nature of Bitcoin and crypto more broadly is “an astonishing thing.” Shortly after the discussion, Snowden posted a tweet describing gold as “Bitcoin that can’t be sent over the Internet.”
Gold is just bitcoin that can't be sent over the internet. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) June 11, 2022
He also namechecked several other innovations in the cryptocurrency space, including the privacy coins Zcash and Monero. Snowden recently revealed that he helped create Zcash under the pseudonym John Dobbertin, and during the discussion he said that he was “really impressed” by its zero-knowledge proof technology when he first read the whitepaper.
Crypto as Money
Elaborating on his views of the promise of crypto technology, Snowden added that many crypto assets are “closer to money” than currencies. “People don’t understand the difference but money is a thing that holds value, a token that can be exchanged that is not independently controlled by any central authority,” he said.
He also warned of the dangers of the financialization of the crypto industry. He said that the space was becoming increasingly divided “because of the financialization of cryptocurrency” and hinted that he thinks users are not focusing enough on the technology itself.
“[Users are] not thinking primarily about what are the networks that are going to serve us for 100 years for transferring value,” he said. “I am worried about a world in which our money is used against us.”
Snowden said that he hopes to see people get access to “free money in the independence sense.” In what could be interpreted as an endorsement of the broader crypto ecosystem rather than any one specific asset, he suggested that having multiple assets that could act as money was a good thing for the world. “I think the more competition we have there, then all the better,” he said.

Almost all major crypto coins, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and others extended their previous day’s losses to shed more value. The global cryptocurrency market was standing at $1.20 trillion, down by 3.19 per cent over the past 24 hours, data showed, as the situation remained more on the negative side.
The crypto coin prices remained unstable for another day as investors seemed undecided regarding attractive prices and worries about rising inflation as well as an economic slowdown. “We are seeing frequent short-term surges in volatility as market participants are trading within in a tight range because they are unsure of how the crypto market would react to macro-economic conditions,” said Darshan Bathija, CEO and co founder of Vauld.
Bitcoin plunged below the $30,000 levels again during early hours of the day and remained in that position. This came after two days of the world’s largest cryptocurrency being flat at the $30,000 mark. Bitcoin price today fell by 2.46 per cent to stand at $29,340.07 at the time of writing this article. Over the past week, Bitcoin rates have gone down by 1.13 per cent. On the other hand, Ether price today took a sharp hit and was standing at $1,669.92, falling by 6.79 per cent over the past 24 hours.
“Though BTC has been moving in tandem with the equities market, its correlation to the S&P 500 index has declined over the past month. If the crypto markets can move away from being correlated to the traditional markets, it would be a highly optimistic signal. While long-term holders are doubling down on their BTC investments, retail investors still remain risk-averse in the current market,” said Bathija.
“With a significant amount of institutional capital continuing to pour into the crypto space, this can potentially be viewed as a reversal of the negative sentiment ever once so prevalent. Going into the second half of 2022, we continue to be optimistic on crypto and web3 adoption as the technology continuously evolves to address existing challenges in the financial sector,” added the CoinDCX research team.
Here are the top 10 cryptocurrencies and their prices on June 11, 2022 ( According to data from coinmarketcap.com)

U.S. inflation print proves setback
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it reached $28,528 on Bitstamp, its lowest since May 28.
The pair had fallen in step with stock markets on June 10, these finishing the week noticeably down — the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively.
This was on the back of surprisingly high inflation data from the United States, which took a turn for the worst in stark contrast to expectations. As Cointelegraph previously reported, at 8.6%, annual inflation came in at the highest since December 1981.
Reacting, market commentators were thus firmly on the bearish side when it came to future BTC price action.
“When we drop to $22,000 - $24,000 on Bitcoin they will call for lower Don’t be too greedy when the time comes,” popular Twitter account Crypto Tony told followers.
Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, meanwhile, contrasted the current environment with the March 2020 COVID-19 crash. This year’s slow bleed, he argued, was if anything more painful than the “car crash” price declines of the time that briefly took Bitcoin to $3,600.
“Inflation hasn't peaked, and neither has Bitcoin,” MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor offered in a more hopeful angle after the data print.
“In the current macro backdrop it doesn't matter how many charts are showing confluence that we are reaching historically oversold levels,” popular Twitter account PlanC countered:
“As long as Bitcoin remains correlated to risk on assets I don’t see a significant trend reversal anytime soon.”
If it were to end the week at current levels or any below $29,450, meanwhile, BTC/USD would be threatening its lowest weekly close since December 2020.

The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) minutes, due for the meeting on June 14-15, will provide clues on how aggressive policymakers plan to be when it comes to stemming price rises.
“I think that at some point, the market will realize that inflation is not going away soon and that rates will still be relatively low,” Twitter account Daan Crypto Trades argued.
It added that gold could provide an early indication of that “new old” trend by rising from its current trading channel.
“$GOLD could be the leading factor in such a shift. Closely watching that. Right now, we’re still in the process of baking in the bad factors,” a post on the day read.

480,2022-06-14,2022-06-14,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Scott Nover,Nicolás Rivero",qz.com,The biggest corporate holder of bitcoin is facing a reckoning,MicroStrategy is staring down a possible margin call on a recent loan to buy more bitcoin.,https://qz.com/2177569/the-biggest-corporate-holder-of-bitcoin-is-facing-a-reckoning/,"MicroStrategy is famous for owning more bitcoin than any other publicly-traded company. As of June 14, the Virginia-based business intelligence company holds 129,218 bitcoins, more than two-and-a-half times as much as Tesla, the next largest bitcoin owner. That bitcoin is now worth about $2.9 billion, less than half of the roughly $6 billion it was worth just two months ago.
MicroStrategy chief Michael Saylor believes so deeply in the promise of the primordial cryptocurrency that the company took out a $205 million loan from Silvergate Bank to buy $190 million worth of bitcoin in April. But since then, the cryptocurrency market, which was already slumping, has gone into free fall.
“Bitcoin needs to cut in half for around $21,000 before we’d have a margin call,” MicroStrategy president Phong Les said in May during an earnings call. But that’s exactly what happened. In the two months since MicroStrategy’s latest bitcoin purchase, the cryptocurrency lost more than half of its value. As of June 14, MicroStrategy has lost $1.1 billion on its bitcoin bet and now may have to post more collateral on their loan.
According to the terms of MicroStrategy’s loan agreement with Silvergate Bank, a margin call could be triggered if bitcoin falls below $21,000 per coin—which, depending on your data source, it might have already done. The website CoinGecko clocked bitcoin’s low at $21,046.95 around 10pm Eastern on June 13, but Bloomberg reported the low at $20,824.
MicroStrategy did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesperson for Silvergate Bank declined to comment for this story.
While it’s unclear whether or not the margin call will happen, MicroStrategy’s response to the bitcoin downturn could augur how a broader set of companies that have muddled their finances with crypto, including Tesla, will navigate the ongoing “crypto winter.”
MicroStrategy’s bitcoin bet
MicroStrategy, which launched in 1989 and develops data mining tools to help businesses make decisions, bought its first 21,454 bitcoins for $250 million in August 2020, citing worries the US dollar would lose value due to the pandemic, government stimulus spending, and political uncertainty around the world. “This investment reflects our belief that bitcoin, as the world’s most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash,” Saylor wrote in a statement at the time.
MicroStrategy wasn’t the only publicly traded company to bet on bitcoin. The Jack Dorsey-run payments company Block (then called Square) bought $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020 as “a hedge” against market downturns, and Elon Musk’s Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin by February 2021 to give itself “more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash,” according to an SEC filing.
But no other company has invested in cryptocurrencies as aggressively as MicroStrategy. The company bought more than $1 billion by the end of 2020 and then, after bitcoin’s price surged above $50,000 for the first time in February 2021, it bought another $1 billion in a single day. In a statement announcing the purchase, Saylor said MicroStrategy had two corporate strategies of similar importance: “growing our enterprise analytics software business and acquiring and holding bitcoin.”
MicroStrategy has now spent more than $4 billion on bitcoin—which is more than twice as much as the company’s $1.7 billion market capitalization. Along the way, MicroStrategy transformed itself from a middling software company into a stock-trader vehicle to speculate on the future value of bitcoin.
Unfortunately for MicroStrategy, it made the bulk of its bitcoin purchases as crypto markets neared their peak. Plus, institutional investors have piled into the crypto market, linking the fate of bitcoin with trends in traditional financial markets; as a result, cryptocurrencies have turned out to be a lousy hedge against inflation and market turmoil. As of June 14, MicroStrategy’s crypto horde is worth about $1.1 billion less than what the company paid for it.
But even as bitcoin has tumbled, MicroStrategy has continued to invest. “Our strategy with bitcoin has been to buy and hold, so to the extent we have excess cash flows or we find other ways to raise money, we continue to put it into bitcoin,” chief financial officer Phong Le told the Wall Street Journal in January.
Will MicroStrategy face a margin call?
This week, Saylor told the Journal he doesn’t think a margin call will happen, but caveated that “the company has plenty of additional collateral should we need to post more.” In a June 14 tweet, Saylor said MicroStrategy has anticipated volatility and “structured its balance sheet so that it could continue to #HODL through adversity.”
Mark Palmer, an equity research analyst at the financial services firm BTIG, told Reuters he sees “no circumstance in which MicroStrategy is going to need to sell any of its bitcoin holdings.” Palmer said that, if needed, MicroStrategy has enough “unencumbered bitcoin” to post as additional collateral.
MicroStrategy’s bitcoin bet, which once helped the stock jump nearly 10-times its value between February 2020 and February 2021, has now dragged it down. The stock’s price fell 72% in the last six months, though it rose 1.5% on June 14 despite the specter of a margin call. In the long run, it seems MicroStrategy’s fate appears more tethered to the caprices of bitcoin, an unregulated and highly volatile alternative currency, than to the company’s core business."

At the time of writing, Bitcoin, the poster boy of crypto coins, is trading at less than half the value it had achieved at its peak in November last year.
Many, however, look at these falls in valuation as an opportunity to get more involved.

Not everybody, though, has the Presidential powers to order Bitcoin buys. Most of us have to do the work ourselves, and the entire process of buying Bitcoin can be quite complex to navigate. If you are a beginner in this space, here's the complete guide to buying Bitcoin.
What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009 to facilitate online transactions between parties without the need for a financial institution such as a bank. To keep the trust in the currency, all transactions are logged in a public ledger, also known as a blockchain, and are visible to anyone.
Since a centralized authority does not issue the currency, transactions on the blockchain need to be confirmed by a third party. This is done by utilizing specialized computers to solve complex mathematical problems, hence the name cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is just one of the globally popular cryptocurrencies. Over the years, the meteoric rise in the value of Bitcoin in U.S. dollars has made this cryptocurrency a popular investment asset.
How can beginners invest in Bitcoin?
As the popularity of Bitcoin has increased, there is an increasingly large number of ways you can invest in Bitcoin. The most popular is to use a cryptocurrency exchange or a broker. An exchange is a platform where buyers and sellers can trade cryptocurrencies.

A cryptocurrency broker works as a stockbroker and is a firm or an individual that acts as an intermediary to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Brokers are generally used by those who trade or invest large amounts of money, such as asset managers. They are also used by speculative investors and those who trade on derivatives. This is when the investor doesn't actually own the crypto coins but speculates on the price movement, 'betting' that it will go up or down.
Most individual retail investors begin with an exchange, where they actually own the coins.
Like any other investments, Bitcoin investments are also subject to market risk, and beginners should exercise caution when making them. Cryptocurrency transactions are currently not regulated by any financial authorities and do not carry the same protection against fraud and theft as that offered on fiat currency held in banks.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments are also not protected by insurance from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. However, at some exchanges, fiat balances in individual accounts may be FDIC-insured up to a certain amount.
Before making any transactions, you should also check out the legal, regulatory, and tax implications of purchasing and selling bitcoin where you live.

Bitcoin prices are somewhat volatile and keep shifting drastically. At the time of writing this, Bitcoin was priced at just under $30,000, but it has seen a high of $47,000 and a low of $28,000 this year alone.
However, you do not have to make massive investments while buying Bitcoin. As a digital currency, a Bitcoin is further divisible into smaller units. It is possible to simply buy a share of a Bitcoin without emptying your coffers in just one go.

You can invest as little as $10 and own a small part of a coin. However, because most platforms charge fixed fees for each transaction, it is usually better to invest in larger amounts at once rather than engage in multiple small transactions and pay a fee each time.
How to buy Bitcoin with PayPal
Most readers are aware of the services that PayPal offers to make global transactions over the internet. The payments company is now doing the same for cryptocurrencies as well. If you have a PayPal account, you can buy Bitcoin and a handful few other cryptocurrencies directly through the website. It is as simple as that.
In most states in the U.S. (but not all), you can use existing PayPal accounts to buy Bitcoin and then spend them with the 'Checkout with Crypto' option. However, to take advantage of this option, PayPal will require further details such as a name, physical address, date of birth, and tax identification number.

While this is very easy, buying Bitcoin with PayPal has several restrictions. You can use your Bitcoin only at sites that accept payments with PayPal and nowhere else. PayPal also charges fees for every transaction involving Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, including a flat fee and a percentage of the total transaction amount. This is like deciding to pay for your groceries in cash and then paying the grocer an additional fee to accept the cash.
You can also use the balance of your PayPal account to purchase cryptocurrencies from a third-party provider. However, only a few third-party sites currently allow users to buy Bitcoin using PayPal.
Although Bitcoin purchased through PayPal initially could not be transferred out of PayPal into external crypto or personal wallet, this is set to change soon. A digital wallet is where owners hold their digital currencies and is secured with a private key known only to the holder. This is a password that prevents your wallet from unauthorized access and is used when making payments.

How to sign up for a Crypto Exchange
For most people, the first step in buying bitcoin involves choosing a crypto exchange. There are many crypto exchange options available today. While most offer similar options, beginners must be careful about what they are signing up for. Some crypto exchanges promise little or no transaction fees. However, most such platforms limit the types of cryptocurrencies you can buy, and many do not offer wallet services. This means that users need to use a separate wallet-providing service to store their Bitcoin.
Globally known platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, or Bitfinex are ideal starting points for beginners since they offer a good mix of straightforward transaction fees and security measures. Note that these exchanges are not decentralized and follow laws that require users to submit identifying documentation.

Before you buy Bitcoin, you must set up an account with the crypto exchange you choose. To set up an account, the exchange will need:
your personal information such as name, date of birth, address, etc., Depending on where you live and the laws in place, you may also need to provide personal documents, such as copies of your driver's license or Social Security card, and information about your employer and/or source of funds,
an email address with a strong password. Most exchanges also use a 2 step verification for added security.
After your identity has been verified and your account approved, you need to connect a payment option to fund your account. Most exchanges allow you to connect your bank account, debit, or credit card. Note that the list of fiat currencies accepted varies from one crypto exchange to another, and some banks do not permit or restrict activity on crypto exchanges.
Peer-to-peer exchanges where buyers from all over the globe are matched also offer an alternative method to buy Bitcoin. These exchanges are attractive since they offer no-to-low transaction fees and tend to work in regions with strict laws against crypto trading. However, the platforms also come with a higher risk of scams by fake users, generally requiring you to store your Bitcoin on the platform's wallet and slow trades that a party can back out of.
How to place an order for Bitcoin on a Crypto Exchange
Depending on the platform you sign up for, you may have to tap on the Bitcoin ticker or search for Bitcoin from the available crypto coins list and then buy the coin.
If you have traded stock through an online brokerage before, you will see that buying Bitcoin at an exchange is not very different. Depending on the funds in your account, you need to place a 'Buy Order'. This is an instruction to buy X units of Bitcoin at Y price.
Crypto exchanges offer several different order types, similar to stock brokerages. Most offer both market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders. Some also offer stop-limit, take-profit, and take-profit limit orders and recurring orders.
Once your buy order is confirmed, the Bitcoin is issued to you. Since the transaction also needs to be recorded on Bitcoin's blockchain, there might be a notable delay between your buying transaction and the Bitcoin showing up in your wallet. Depending on how busy the blockchain is, your transactions may take between 10 minutes to two hours to get confirmed.
Where to store your Bitcoin
Most of the exchanges offer a hosted wallet to store Bitcoin. This is where the exchange holds the Bitcoin you buy, and you do not have to worry about losing the private key to your wallet. This is more or less like a bank account, where your money is held safely without you fretting about its security. However, hosted wallets come with limited features and security — they can be hacked and the Bitcoin stolen.
Enthusiasts who want to explore Bitcoin applications further use personal wallets where only the owner has control of the private key to execute transactions with it. This avoids the risk of the exchange getting hacked. However, if the private key is lost or forgotten, there is no way to claim ownership or conduct transactions of the Bitcoin you bought.
Setting up a personal or self-custody wallet can also be straightforward. Thanks to smartphones, all you need to do is
Download the self-custody wallet app,
Create an account. Here you may not even need an email address,
Write down your private key, a 12-word phrase,
Transfer the crypto you buy to the self-custody wallet.
However, these online or ""hot"" wallets are always connected to the internet and risk being targeted in online attacks. To safeguard themselves from such attacks, some Bitcoin holders also turn to ""cold"", or hardware wallets. These are physical devices that store the private keys to your Bitcoin in an offline location. So, even if hackers get into your computer, your Bitcoin remains out of their reach.
Cold wallets can be the size of a thumb drive and cost around $100. To use them, you will need to
Buy the hardware wallet from a reputed provider,
Install their proprietary software in the drive and create your wallet,
Transfer your crypto from your existing wallet to the cold wallet.
How to Buy Bitcoin With a Credit Card
While tapping into your credit limit might seem like an easy option, it is important to remember that Bitcoin is a volatile and risky asset, and you might end up paying high-interest rates on an investment that has lost value.
Due to the risk of fraud, many exchanges do not allow purchases with credit cards. When they do, there are usually added processing fees. On top of this, credit card companies also recognize when you are using the card on these platforms. Credit card issuers treat bitcoin purchases as cash advances and charge high fees and high-interest rates on these transactions. So, it can be expensive to buy Bitcoin with a credit card.
How to Buy Bitcoin using an ATM
Bitcoin ATMs act like an in-person bitcoin exchange and offer the option of paying cash for your Bitcoin purchases. These look and function much like your bank's ATMs, and you might also find them at your nearest supermarket or Walmart. These ATMs charge a little extra for the convenience they bring to you.
Buyers insert cash into the ATM and purchase bitcoin that is then transferred to your online wallet.
However, ATMs can be an expensive option. There are two charges associated with ATM bitcoin purchases: a purchase fee and a conversion fee for converting a fiat currency to bitcoin. Both fees are relatively steep compared to those of other options. For example, the average Bitcoin ATM fee is around 11 percent or 12 percent, with some ATMs charging up to 25 percent. Most Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. will also require a government-issued ID.
What is the safest way to buy Bitcoin?
To ensure that your investments are safe, always ensure that you carry out your transactions on a crypto exchange that is trusted by many other users and not just because it offers free transactions or promises high returns. Crypto coin investments that offer immediate returns are a tell-tale sign of a scam, and there are many crypto scams out there.
Even after you buy Bitcoin, you must store it in a safe digital wallet with perfect security measures. Since cryptocurrency transactions are recorded in a public ledger, it is effortless for hackers to find out how much Bitcoin you hold. If your wallet is hacked and your Bitcoin has been stolen, law enforcement authorities will not swing into action to recover it.
If you have stored your Bitcoin in a personal, self-custody wallet, you need to be more vigilant about being targeted.
To keep your Bitcoin safe, stay away from schemes that offer you great returns in short times, and do not write down your private keys as part of email messages and then send them over.
Some websites also let you create paper wallets, where the public and private keys can be printed on paper that holders then laminate and keep in safe deposit boxes, away from prying eyes. However, going through this process might be overkill if your holdings are small.
If you are looking at trading Bitcoin, a recommended way to keep your assets safe would be to keep some Bitcoin in an online wallet to trade regularly and move significant holdings to a cold wallet.

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) briefly slipped below $21,000 in the early hours of Tuesday morning, a 52-week low for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Bitcoin dropped to lows of $20,950, according to data from CoinMarketCap, before recovering to its current price of around $22,620, down over 6% on the day.
With a current market capitalization of $430 billion, Bitcoin is down over 66% from its all-time high of $68,789 recorded in November 2021.
Bitcoin leads liquidation in the cryptocurrency market with $531.62 million liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass.
The Bitcoin fear and greed index hit 8 out of 100, its lowest level since May 2022, suggesting extreme anxiety in the market.
Earlier today, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, dropped to $1,094.70, also recording a 52-week low. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,220, up 1.3% on the day.
Why did Bitcoin crash?
The primary reasons behind today’s bearish price actions are growing global inflation rates and rate hikes by the U.S Federal Reserve.
The U.S. inflation rate hit a 40-year high of 8.6%, but America isn’t alone. Rising prices are a global phenomenon, with all significant economies facing inflation.
The inflation rate of European countries including Germany (7.9%), France (5.25%), Netherlands (8.8%), and the United Kingdom (9%), shot up in May 2022.
Turkey is the worst-hit G20 nation, with inflation rates soaring past 73.5%, according to data from Trading Economics.
The increasing inflation rate globally is fueled by the rising fuel costs and changing supply-chain dynamics resulting from Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
In order to control inflation, the Fed is expected to implement a 0.75% percentage point rate hike, which in turn would tremendously increase bond yields, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The Fed will conduct a meeting to discuss the issue today, with an announcement expected to follow tomorrow if the planned rate hike goes through.
Of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have shown gains over the past 24-hours. SOL and ADA are both up over 14%, while DOGE is trading slightly higher by 5.6% over the same period."

Having once lost $6 billion at the height of the dotcom bubble, software entrepreneur Michael Saylor is no stranger to volatility in the financial markets. In 1999, MicroStrategy, Saylor's software firm, admitted to overstating its revenues and erroneously reporting a profit when it actually made a loss. The fiasco shaved over $11 billion off MicroStrategy's stock market value in a single day. Now, more than two decades later, MicroStrategy is again facing questions over some of its accounting practices — this time in relation to a $4 billion bet on bitcoin. The world's biggest cryptocurrency briefly tumbled below $21,000 Tuesday, a key level at which MicroStrategy would be faced with a possible margin call that investors fear could force the company to liquidate its bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. In a tweet Tuesday, Saylor said MicroStrategy ""anticipated volatility and structured its balance sheet so that it could continue to #HODL through adversity."" HODL is a slang term in crypto aimed at discouraging investors from selling.
$1 billion loss
Saylor first got into bitcoin in 2020, when he decided to start adding the cryptocurrency to MicroStrategy's balance sheet as part of an unorthodox treasury management strategy.
His belief was a common one among the crypto faithful — that bitcoin provides a store of value uncorrelated with traditional financial markets. That's turned out to be a risky gamble, with digital currencies now moving in lockstep with stocks and other assets plunging amid fears of an aggressive interest rate hiking cycle from the Federal Reserve.
Bitcoin's price plunged 10% to $20,843 on Tuesday, extending a brutal sell-off and dragging it deeper into levels not seen since December 2020. It comes after crypto lending firm Celsius halted withdrawals on Monday, citing ""extreme market conditions."" MicroStrategy has bet billions on the cryptocurrency — $3.97 billion, to be exact. As at March 31, MicroStrategy held 129,218 bitcoins, each purchased at an average price of $30,700, according to a company filing.
With bitcoin currently trading at $22,818, MicroStrategy's crypto stash would now be worth just over $2.9 billion. That translates to an unrealized loss of more than $1 billion.
Margin call
To add to MicroStrategy's woes, the company now faces what's known as a ""margin call,"" a situation where an investor has to commit more funds to avoid losses on a trade augmented with borrowed cash. The company took out a $205 million loan from Silvergate, a crypto-focused bank, to continue its bitcoin buying spree. To secure the loan, MicroStrategy posted some of the bitcoin it held on its books as collateral. Silvergate did not immediately return a request for comment."

With a net asset value of $18bn (£14.9bn) in its last public statement, the Singapore-based hedge fund was known for taking large, highly leveraged stakes in crypto businesses and cryptocurrencies directly. It holds positions in cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, as well as equity investments in companies such as the BlockFi exchange and options trading platform Deribit.
The turmoil in the crypto markets has substantially reduced the value of those holdingsand wiped out some other stakes the fund, known as 3AC, has taken, including in doomed “algorithmic stablecoin” project Terra and “play-to-earn” game Axie Infinity, which was the victim of a $700m hack late last year, attributed to North Korean state-sponsored hackers.
Zhu Su, the Dubai-based investor behind the crypto-focused trading house, tweeted on Wednesday morning that “we are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out”.
We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out — Zhu Su 🔺 (@zhusu) June 15, 2022
With traders already nursing wounds after a 25% drop in the price of bitcoin in a single day, sparked by the announcement by ersatz crypto bank Celsius that it would be suspending withdrawals, Zhu’s statement kicked off a further day of turmoil in the crypto sector. Crypto exchange Binance’s chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, described the situation as a “bloodbath”.
Bitcoin’s value continued to tumble on Wednesday, to just over $20,000, 70% below its record high of $69,000 in November.
Tether, the centralised stablecoin which holds systemic importance to the wider cryptocurrency sector, published a statement denying any losses from 3AC or Celsius.
“Celsius position has been liquidated with no losses to Tether,” the company said. “Tether’s lending activity with Celsius (as with any other borrower) has always been overcollateralized. Tether has currently zero exposure to Celsius apart from a small investment made out of Tether equity in the company.”
The company had previously told the Financial Times that its loans to Celsius were 30% over-collateralised, meaning it had taken $1.30 in bitcoin for every $1 it lent out.
Tether added: “Tether is aware of other rumours being spread, suggesting that it has lending exposure to Three Arrows Capital – again this is categorically false.”
The company also dismissed claims that its large holdings of commercial paper – short-term loans to businesses – were held in disproportionately risky investments. It also said that it intended to replace those holdings with US Treasury bonds, though offered no date by which that switch was intended to have occurred.

On Wednesday, the Tron DAO reserve project, which backs the USDD algorithmic stablecoin, announced it was withdrawing more than $100m worth of cryptocurrency from Binance in order to support the dollar peg of its stablecoin, which had slipped to $0.97 on crypto exchanges. That sparked fears that the stablecoin might follow in the footsteps of its similarly structured peer UST, the collapse of which precipitated the latest crisis.
Teunis Brosens, head economist for digital finance at Dutch bank ING, said that while the run on cryptocurrencies could partly be explained by wider market conditions, the recent collapse of the Terra stablecoin project had sparked a deeper concern about the overall viability of some of the less well-known digital assets. “Crypto investors have grown very critical, especially about the more complex products, and want to get out. There may still be confidence in bitcoin and Ethereum, which are the more straightforward currencies, but as people scramble to get out of the complex products, entities like Celsius have to liquidate their conventional coins like bitcoin and Ethereum, which only depresses their price further.”
On Tuesday evening, Bill Gates warned that the Crypto sector was a bubble economy, “100% based on greater fool theory”, the idea that profit comes from finding someone dumber than you to sell your asset to. “I’m used to asset classes … like a farm where they have output, or like a company where they make products,” Gates said."

Bitcoin prices have suffered some turbulence lately, repeatedly approaching $20,000 and falling to some of their lowest values since late 2020.
The digital currency dropped to $20,079.72 yesterday morning, TradingView figures show, its lowest since December 2020.
The cryptocurrency then bounced back, surpassing $21,700 yesterday afternoon, additional TradingView data reveals.
Today, bitcoin prices made another move toward $20,000, falling below $20,300.
[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]
Fed Rate Hike
The digital currency made this latest attempt on the $20,000 level shortly after the Federal Open Market Committee issued a statement revealing that it was raising the target for the federal funds rate to between 1.5% and 1.75%.
This announcement confirmed the expectation, held by many, that the FOMC would in fact hike its benchmark rate by 75 basis points, the largest increase since 1994.
This development does not bode well for risk assets, as ratcheting up the federal funds rate places upward pressure on broader interest rates, which in turns causes bonds to provide more compelling yields.
Since market participants can obtain greater rewards by putting their money into low-risk investments, they have less incentive to opt for risk assets. This, in turn, could place downward pressure on the prices of assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks.
Following these latest developments, experts shed some light on what bitcoin prices might do next.
Key Technical Levels
Several market observers pointed to the $20,000 price level, highlighting its importance and emphasizing that bitcoin has been unable to break through the support there.
“BTC’s hard bounce off of $20k clearly illustrates the strong psychological support at $20k – both because it was the prior ATH (all-time high) and because it’s a nice round number,” said analyst Tim Enneking.
“Interestingly, once BTC has set a new ATH (in this case, about $70k), it has never taken out the prior ATH. Dropping below $20k would, therefore, be a first,” stated Enneking, who is the managing director of Digital Capital Management and co-founder and managing partner of financial services firm Psalion.
“My best guess is that BTC will fall below $20k, but not for long and not very far,” he added.
Richard Usher, head of OTC Trading at BCB Group, also weighed in on this important psychological level, stating that “a quick run below 20,000 is almost inevitable” because of the FOMC’s rate hike and press conference.
He offered some insight on what the cryptocurrency might do after falling below the $20,000 mark.
“I think a stop loss run will cleanse a few short term positions out of the market and I believe a move sub $20,000 will be short lived. I think we will try to establish a low around $17,500/$18,000 before recovering.”
Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, pointed out a similar support level, highlighting $17,000 as being “important.” He noted that if bitcoin broke through support there, $13,000 would be the next key level.
Usher and DiPasquale also highlighted crucial levels of resistance, with the former stating that “a break back above $23,000 should confirm a short term low is in place” and the latter indicating that “on the upside, $25K is the first step toward any real reversal.”
Bitcoin’s Outlook Uncertain
Several analysts emphasized that due to variables like macroeconomic uncertainty and bitcoin’s high correlation with equities, the digital currency’s future outlook is murky.
“This is the first time in crypto’s history that it’s experiencing a bear market alongside the global economy,” said Jesse Proudman, VP Crypto Investing for Betterment.
“This is exacerbated by systematic headwinds as significant leverage is being unwound from the system,” he added.
“Exactly where we are in that unwind is the critical question and will likely dictate which way price moves.”
Collin Plume, CEO and founder of My Digital Money, also chimed in.
“I think digital currency is yet to hit rock bottom and it's both a function of fear and uncertainty brought by our economic crash in epic proportions and cunning and hopeful desires to buy low,” he stated.
Plume stated that “crypto investors are starting to take cover” by flocking to “tangible” assets such as “cash and precious metals.”
He noted that many crypto investors are selling their digital currencies, even if they have to incur a loss to do so.
“Couple that with crypto prophets declaring Bitcoin will go down below $10K and you have a market that is both cautious and hopeful,” said Plume.
“They don't see the harm in walking away from the crypto market right now since it's going to go down anyway. They can just hold their tangible assets and when things get better, crypto bottoms and they can buy in again for optimal gains,” he noted.
“It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Plume concluded.
Enneking also commented on bitcoin’s future market prospects.
“The biggest issue is how long it will take for a truly meaningful recovery. Given the challenges in the fiat macroeconomic world, which now affect crypto so strongly because of the ‘daylight correlation’ between equities (especially US equities) and crypto (especially BTC), it may take a while for BTC to rebound significantly.”
Veteran Investors Undeterred, Says Analyst
Regardless of how the markets have been performing lately, veteran crypto investors are unfazed, claimed Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky, founder and CEO of Allnodes Inc.
“There are different kinds of crypto traders; believers in Blockchain technology and its value and those who invest in the prices of cryptocurrencies,” he stated.
“These newcomers joined the latest crypto bull run in hopes of making it rich quickly. These are the same people pulling out of the crypto market right now, affected by the Fed's interest rate hikes, rising inflation, and potential crypto regulations.”
“The devotees, on the other hand, are not going anywhere,” the analyst said.
“They are rebalancing their crypto portfolios, getting involved deeper, doing more research, waiting it out, or getting in at lucrative prices.”"

The sell-off in cryptocurrencies deepened even further on Wednesday, with bitcoin sinking very close to the key level of $20,000.
Bitcoin plunged as much as 10% to an intraday low of $20,166, according to Coinbase data. It was last trading at $21,544.37, down about 2.6%, around 4:24 p.m. ET. The world's largest digital currency has plunged nearly 70% since the peak of the crypto craze in November 2021.
Charlie Morris, founder of digital asset management firm ByteTree, said $20,000 was close to the peak of bitcoin's last major bull run in 2017 and so ""might prove to be a support level.""
""At $20k, bitcoin has made no money since the 2017 high, but that disguises the outsized returns over all prior time frames,"" he told CNBC.
Digital tokens are in free fall as fears of climbing inflation, aggressive interest rate rises and liquidity issues at a key player in the crypto space have plagued crypto markets.
The Federal Reserve raised rates by 75 basis points, as was widely expected. Chairman Jerome Powell also signaled that another 0.75 percentage point hike could come next month, if inflation remains high.
Mostafa Al-Mashita, executive vice president of Canadian crypto firm SDM, said crypto has been caught up in the broader ""risk-off environment"" affecting markets."

This caused the price of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, to drop to $20,392 Wednesday afternoon Eastern Time. It has since bounced back, and at the time of writing was trading at $21,559.63, according to CoinMarketCap.
Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market have taken a beating over the past several weeks as investors shed risky assets from their portfolios.

The crypto carnage carries on as nervous investors rush for the exits and huge digital-asset-focused firms Celsius and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) feel the heat.
Crypto-lending giant Celsius was already sitting in a stagnating pool of its own sweat, and it’s now come to light that 3AC appears to be in hot financial water, too.
At the moment, the entire crypto market cap is languishing below a trill at US$917 billion, with Bitcoin (BTC) inching ever closer to US$20k and Ethereum (ETH) threatening to dip to three figures. More than US$400 billion has been wiped from the space since this time a week ago.
If dry-powder-stacking opportunists were waiting for bloody streets, they’ve got them, although the horror show could be about to get worse…
3AC liquidation woes
Three Arrows Capital, the huge Dubai and Singapore-based crypto-focused venture capital firm, is staring down the barrel of possible insolvency after it suffered more than US$400 million in liquidations, The Block reported today.
At its peak, 3AC was estimated (by blockchain analytics firm Nansen) to have owned about US$10 billion in assets, controlling more than 5 per cent of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.
Overshadowed by the Celsius platform’s own dramas, Twitter chatter has been swirling this week regarding 3AC’s asset movements to various DeFi platforms such as Aave, in a possible attempt to avoid liquidations. The rumour is the firm has been unable to meet a margin call.
On-chain data suggests that 3AC has been selling assets in bulk to lower collateral requirements for certain positions. According to CoinDesk, one of 3AC’s wallets has a debt totalling more than US$183 million.
This wallet (tagged as 3AC on Nansen) has been aggressively paying back AAVE debt against its 223k ETH / $264mm position to avoid liquidation. With $198mm in borrowings against it, @ a 85% liq threshold, a -11% move in ETH to $1,042 liqudates ithttps://t.co/y7yJJ0NlMc pic.twitter.com/2S55Rzl9Xc — Onchain Wizard (@OnChainWizard) June 15, 2022
After remaining unusually silent earlier this week, 3AC’s founder, the normally highly Twitter-vocal Su Zhu, has now addressed the social media throng with this short, unsatisfying statement:
We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out — Zhu Su 🔺 (@zhusu) June 15, 2022
Suspicions of 3AC’s trouble apparently intensified a few days ago when Zhu removed from his Twitter bio all mention of various investments including Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Terra (LUNA), Solana (SOL) and others – keeping only Bitcoin (BTC). The VC founder also recently deleted his Instagram account.
3AC in trouble? rumors swirling – Kyle and Zhu havent tweeted or liked anything in days
– Zhu took every coin and # tag out of his bio
– Zhu deleted his instagram
– an hour ago they dumped 30k stETH and reduced all AAVE positions — moon (@MoonOverlord) June 14, 2022
There’s mounting speculation that 3AC’s potential woes could all be one big soupy mess of overexposure to Celsius, the crashed Terra ecosystem, Staked Ether (stETH) and other over-leveraged investments.

Exchanges flood with Bitcoin inflows
Bitcoin is currently changing paper hands for about US$20.5k – the lowest it’s been since December 2020, and moving closer to the previous bull market (2018) peak of just under $20k. It’s now down about 34% on the week and the month, and 70% away from the heady, meme-ish days of US$69k.
As the leading crypto and overall market health barometer, the fears are that the BTC sell-off is set to get a fair bit worse before things get better, despite some calling for a bottom at pretty much this level.
Those fears are being compounded by the amount of inflows of BTC to major exchanges this week – spiking to near three-and-a-half-year highs.
As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows that users of 21 major exchanges sent Bitcoin to their wallets in bulk on June 14, with 59,356 of BTC moving into the guest room and making themselves at home.
It’s the largest daily inflow of BTC to exchanges since November 30, 2018.
As for the actual selling, crypto exchanges FTX and Binance have been host to most of that pressure, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki-Young Ju.

Bitcoin’s value has plunged by 22 per cent in the past five days as investors rush to sell the cryptocurrency amid fears that an asset bubble is bursting.
The average bitcoin buyer is now in the red after the world’s most popular cryptocurrency shed a trillion dollars in value in two months.
For El Salvador, which staked its economy on the success of bitcoin when it became the first country to make cryptocurrency legal tender in September 2021, the crash has wiped out more than half of its bitcoin holdings – and could be the death knell for its national crypto experiment.

El Salvador has invested heavily in creating and promoting the bitcoin infrastructure that president Nayib Bukele said would help Salvadorans access banking, save money on international payments and boost the economy.
Those promises are yet to be realised as most Salvadorans have shunned the cryptocurrency, preferring to continue using the US dollar.
The Central American nation also spent an estimated $105.6 million of taxpayers’ money on bitcoin in the hope that its value would rise. Each time its value has dropped, Bukele has bought more, live-tweeting the purchases.
With the cryptocurrency’s value now 70 per cent below its November 2021 peak, $58.1 million is believed to have been wiped out.

El Salvador’s minister of finance Alejandro Zelaya told a press conference on 13 June that the risk of the bitcoin fund was “extremely minimal” and that the country hasn’t lost anything as it hasn’t yet sold its holdings.
“Forty-million dollars does not even represent 0.5 per cent of our national general budget,” said Zelaya.
But the drop in value is a vast sum in a low-income nation of 6.5 million people with growing debt and an economy less than a hundredth of the size of the UK’s.
The Salvadoran government won’t publish its spending on bitcoin, but the cost of buying it, rolling out bitcoin ATMs and developing software has probably cost El Salvador at least $200 million, says David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain. “Blowing $200 million would be like the US blowing $200 billion,” he says. “People will feel it.”
“But also, it hasn’t just blown that money. Bukele has alienated the World Bank, the IMF and all the other people he needed to borrow the money from to pay his bills,” says Gerard.
As El Salvador’s bitcoin gamble fails, economists increasingly fear that El Salvador is heading for a default. The country’s credit rating has been consistently downgraded since it embraced bitcoin and its debt payments are being bought with a heavy price discount as investors fear it can’t make them, Bloomberg reports.

A billion-dollar bond that was planned to launch in March could have helped El Salvador raise capital outside of traditional markets, but it has been put on ice because of unfavourable market conditions.
Prior to the latest price crash, El Salvador’s national bitcoin push was already failing. A study published in May found that most Salvadorans abandoned the national bitcoin wallet after receiving a sign-up bonus and most who continue to use it trade dollars, not cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin’s current price crash could be the final nail in the coffin for bitcoin in El Salvador, says Oscar Salguero, a software developer from San Salvador. “Now the price of bitcoin is coming down quickly, even less people will use it.”
Salguero says the money lost on bitcoin should have addressed poverty or a series of national crises. El Salvador is currently mired in severe floods and a draconian crackdown on drug gangs that has left nearly 2 per cent of El Salvador’s adult population behind bars.
On top of soaring inflation, Salvadorans who trade or hold bitcoin are now feeling extra financial pain. “Everything, everything is expensive, which means we’re not earning anything,” says Carolina Reyes, a food vendor who accepts bitcoin in the tourist town of El Palmarcito. “And now everyone is losing their money in bitcoin. Imagine!”
Some Salvadorans have said that even if bitcoin’s value continues to tumble, Bukele, an ex-marketer who has staked his image as a tech-savvy messiah on his cryptocurrency gambit, is unlikely to turn back.
“They are never going to accept that they have failed on this,” says Mario Gomez, a developer who was detained by police for criticising the bitcoin law.
We corrected how much of its value bitcoin has lost since November 2021."

With inflation in the U.S. soaring past 8.6% in May 2022, the Fed made the the most aggressive rate hike in 28 years yesterday.
Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 5.7% over the past 24 hours and is currently hovering around $21,400, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has gained 10.9% in the last 24 hours and is currently changing hands for around $1,140.
The global cryptocurrency market capitalization is up 6.76% to $921.5 billion over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana (18.12%) and Polkadot (11.50%) (20.61%) have also posted double-digit gains over the past 24 hours.
However, those gains have not been enough to offset losses from the recent crypto crash, with Bitcoin down 30% on the week and Ethereum down 37% in the same period. Bitcoin is down over 68% from its all-time high of $69,000 recorded in November 2021; Ethereum has shed 76% from its all-time high of $4,891 in the same month.
Over $406 million has been liquidated in the crypto market over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass.
Ethereum leads liquidations with $160 million liquidated, closely followed by Bitcoin with $131 million and Solana with $8.8 million over the same period of time.
Slumping DeFi activity
Irrespective of today’s price rally, on-chain activity across blockchains remains stagnant.
According to DefiLlama, Total Value Locked (TVL) across all the blockchains is down 2.2% in the last 24 hours.

TVL on Ethereum slipped 2.55% to $49.3 billion over the last day. Tron leads gains in TVL, with a 3.66% increase over the same period of time.
Overall NFT trading volumes on Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain and Flow are down at least 10% over the past 24 hours, per data from CryptoSlam.
Outside the crypto market, stock markets across the globe are in the red during today’s trading hours. The UK’s FTSE index is down 1.45%, Germany’s DAX index is down 2.08%, France’s CAC index is down 1.63%, and India’s Sensex index is down 1.66%."

Bitcoin price shows a textbook-like Elliot Wave pattern on the macro count. One more bull-run into $80,000 and above is still in the cards for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin price can still rise to new heights
Bitcoin price reeks of bearish sentiment. Twitter accounts, Telegram chats and Celebrity Influencers have all come out to bash the peer-to-peer digital currency. Fellow analysts who are highly regarded for their previous successes argue with conviction of a $14,000 Bitcoin price in the near future. Is everyone right? or does Bitcoin have one more ""shock the world"" bullet in the chamber?
Bitcoin price has an alternative count that still remains very bullish. In fact, the technicals for this unpopular wave count suggests that now is the perfect time to begin buying Bitcoin from a dollar-cost average approach. Having a transaction filled during the true bottom of any market is something traders rarely experience in their careers.
Albeit Bitcoin provides textbook-like confluence suggesting the current mudslide, Fed’s hike induced, LUNA rug-pull to blame, downtrend is merely a shallow wave 4 in the grand scheme of things. A Fibonacci retracement tool surrounding the entirety of wave 3 (since the coronavirus lows of 2020 into all-time highs at $69,000) indicates the recently breached $22,910 level as just a 38.2% retracement. Textbook for a shallow wave 4 pattern.
BTC/USDT 1-Week Chart
Keep in mind that the Elliott Wave rule of alteration suggests waves 2 and 4 alternate in retracement percentages. Precisely what was seen during the 70% retracement into $4,435 during March 2020 that this alternative count has marked as a deep wave 2.
Another textbook-like confluence is visible on the Relative Strength Index. Notice the divergence between wave 2 and wave 4. The indicator suggests the current BTC price at $20,910 is more oversold than when the Bitcoin price traded at $4,435 in March 2020.
BTC/USDT 1-Week Chart
Last but not least, while Crypto Fear And Greed Index has printed the highest historical sentiment fear reading to date, the Bitcoin price has just retested the Elliott Wave parallel trend channel for the first time in history. When combined, the stars could be aligning in favor of the Bitcoin price to make one more bull-run. Conventional targets at $69,000 to mitigate the all-time high, price discovery projections in the $80,000 region, and FOMO-induced madness could fuel the bullish flame for a lot more.
BTC/USDT 1-Week Chart
Invalidation of the entire macro count for Bitcoin price is now 35% below current market value at $13,880. If $13,880 is breached, it's over. Everyone else was right, and Armageddon is here. Bitcoin price will see a fatal demise towards $10,000 and possibly $4,000, resulting in an 80% decline from the current BTC price."

Alejandro Zelaya, the treasury minister of El Salvador, called out the critics of the investments that his country, through the action of President Nayib Bukele, has made in bitcoin. Zelaya stated that there had not been any losses because the bitcoin purchased — around 2,300 BTC — had not been sold. He also qualified the coverage that some media is engaging in about the issue as “biased.”
El Salvador Dismisses Bitcoin Losses
The government of El Salvador is being criticized for the bet that its president, Nayib Bukele, has made on bitcoin, purchasing more than 2,300 BTC for the treasury of the country. Alejandro Zelaya, who is the treasury minister of El Salvador, has minimized the loss that the country has taken as a result of these investments, saying that it is not significant in the big picture.
On the issue, Zelaya stated:
There is a lot of fuss about our Bitcoin strategy, they speculate with an alleged loss of $40 million that has not occurred, because we have not sold the coins, they have not been disposed of.
In an earlier interview, Zelaya had also stated these coins purchased were not to be sold at a loss, and that they were going to wait until the price reached higher numbers.
Biased Media Coverage
The treasury minister of El Salvador complained about media coverage on this issue, noting that reports had been biased due to the position that some media outlets have on bitcoin. Zelaya even named some outlets by name, declaring:
I have even seen Deutsche Welle, with all due respect, I have seen biased reports, it says that El Salvador is being dragged down by a fiscal risk of $40 million. Oh my God! Our General Budget of the Nation is almost $8,000 million; $40 million does not represent even 0.5% of our budget.
However, to Zelaya, this is proof that some of these media outlets have animosity towards bitcoin which is also affecting El Salvador as the first country to adopt it as legal tender.
Even with the current unrealized losses on this bitcoin investment, the appreciation that Salvadorans have for their president is mostly favorable, with Bukele’s administration earning more than eight points out of ten in two recent polls completed by different national universities. Some institutions are worried about the lack of transparency in which these investments are being carried out directly by Bukele.

Here’s what several analysts in the market are saying about the outlook for Bitcoin moving forward as crypto traders try to determine if the bottom is in or if there is more downside ahead.
Expect multi-month consolidation at the 200-week MA
A macro perspective of the journey that Bitcoin has taken over the years and how its past can offer insight into the current market setup was discussed by analyst and pseudonymous Twitter user Rekt Capital, who posted the following chart highlighting BTC’s behavior near its 200-week moving average (MA).

Rekt Capital said,
“If #BTC continues to hold the orange 200-week MA as support and the black 200-week EMA figures as resistance… $BTC could form an Accumulation Range here, just like in 2018. This would enable multi-month consolidation to even as far as December 2022.”
If this is the scenario that plays out, then crypto traders need not rush to accumulate BTC, a point noted by crypto trader and pseudonymous Twitter user Altcoin Sherpa, who posted several charts highlighting the amount of time that BTC spent in previous accumulation phases.

The longest accumulation period noted by Altcoin Sherpa is the 287 day span outlined in the chart above. Other examples provided include the 133 days of accumulation between November 2018 and April 2019 and the 63 days of accumulation between May 2020 and July 2020.
Altcoin Sherap said,
“It's likely that you will get plenty of time to catch a bottom during the accumulation phase. #Bitcoin takes a while for its bottom to form and you should probably just go out and touch some grass instead of knife catching.”
Bitcoin could reclaim $25,000, if we're lucky
A more positive take on the latest developments for Bitcoin was offered by crypto trader Nebraskangooner, who provided the following chart noting that the “lower Fibonacci level has been reached.”
BTC/USDT 1-week chart. Source: Twitter
Nebraskangooner said,
“Let's see if daily can close strong above resistance and then we have a chance for $25,000 and possibly mid $30K's. For the first time in months, we might finally be ready for the bounce everyone has been calling for since $40K.”

The RSI 1000 provides a bullish sign
Another trader who has spotted a potentially bullish signal on the chart for BTC is pseudonymous Twitter user TAnalyst, who posted the following chart highlighting the recent low for the relative strength index (RSI) 1000.
BTC/USD vs. RSI 1000 1-day chart. Source: Twitter
TAnalyst said,
“#Bitcoin It is only on bottom days, BEFORE BULL RUNS, that the daily RSI(1000) is below 50. Today : RSI(1000) = 49.91. Conclude.”
Based on the history of an RSI 1000 score falling below 50, the price of Bitcoin could soon begin to climb higher.
Perhaps the best summary of the current state of the Bitcoin market and the confusion it is causing crypto traders was offered by crypto educator IncomeSharks.
#Bitcoin- At a price where shorting no longer makes sense. But also at a price that longing is still very risky. Unless using tight risk management this is a spot buy only zone for majority. It's ok to wait for a trend to develop to start trading again. — IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) June 16, 2022
The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $905 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 44.3%

toggle caption Dan Kitwood/Getty Images
Whether prices are up or down, for many investors in cryptocurrency, the real appeal is that there's nobody in charge.
As the crowd chanted at the recent Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, it's all about ""Freedom!"" By design, the system is meant to be from interference by banks, companies and governments.
But a new report finds that the decentralized system might not be working as well as many crypto enthusiasts assume.
The report was commissioned by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and the work was done by the software security research company Trail of Bits.
Trail of Bits CEO Dan Guido says blockchain — the public ledgers that keep track of cryptocurrencies, which are replicated on computers around the world — isn't the egalitarian tech its advocates claim.
""It's been taken for granted that the blockchain is immutable and decentralized, because the community says so,"" says Guido.
But in practice, he says, these networks have evolved in ways that concentrate power in the hands of certain people or companies, including the large pools of ""miners"" whose computers earn virtual currency by maintaining the blockchains.
Guido's team calls these potential situations ""unintended centralities"" — situations in which someone gains leverage over the decentralized system, creating opportunities for tampering with the record of who owns what.
Another example in the report of this kind of concentration is the fact that 60% of Bitcoin traffic is handled by just three internet service providers.
""Let's say somebody with great top-down control of the internet in their country starts to interfere with that network,"" Guido says. By slowing down or stopping legitimate blockchain traffic, an attacker could become the ""majority"" voice in the consensus of what's written to a blockchain at that moment.
""They can rewrite history. They can censor transactions. They can make it so that you can't spend your Bitcoin,"" says Guido. ""It's definitely something people would want to do if they want to 'grief' the network.""
The notion of this kind of attack isn't new, but what the Trail of Bits report does is compile research into different kinds of ""unintended centralities"" to better understand the technology's overall vulnerability.
Some of the findings are ""eyebrow-raising,"" says Josh Baron, project manager of the unit at DARPA that commissioned the report.
""For example, the idea that 21 percent of Bitcoin nodes are running an old version of the Bitcoin core client that's known to be vulnerable,"" Baron says, referring to the basic software running that blockchain. That means all those computer are open to the same kind of hack — a big first step for an attacker trying to dominate a blockchain network, sometimes called a ""51 percent attack.""
""You're already worried about 51 percent, and now I'm telling you that 21 percent are just out there for the taking, as it were. That's that's not great,"" Baron says.
So far, the risks outlined in the report don't seem to be a major concern for the cryptocurrency business. NPR approached some of the larger companies, such as Coinbase, for a response, but they declined.
Yan Pritzker, co-founder of a smaller Bitcoin services company called Swan, told NPR he sees the risks as ""theoretical.""
""If this kind of attack is possible, why hasn't it happened?"" Pritzer asks. ""I think the proof is in the pudding a little bit. In real-world conditions, these things don't happen.""
Pritzker agrees with the report on this point: There is more centralization in some of the newer forms of cryptocurrency, especially those that rely on a system called ""proof of stake,"" which uses less computing power. He's more confident in the resilience of Bitcoin, because its energy-intensive ""proof of work"" blockchain would take much more computing energy to corrupt.
Pritzker also points out that this research was commissioned by a government agency.
""They're basically doing endgame research,"" he says of reports like this. ""Their game is, 'how do we get better control of the currency,' and 'how do we build better systems for our control of the currency'.""
Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, sees the report as useful, but not too worrying.
""Some of the concerns I think are valid, but maybe the danger to the broader ecosystem is a little overstated,"" he says, noting that it's important to keep in mind that cryptocurrency systems aren't completely autonomous. Loose associations of humans — volunteers and ""core developers"" — are working constantly to maintain and improve them.
""You could imagine some of the issues [in the report] being exploited, eventually — and I think it will happen potentially for some of these,"" Catalini says. ""[But] the community can always coordinate, respond and, I think over time, will get better at developing the right solutions.""
Because cryptocurrencies are decentralized, with no oversight by governments or central banks, those solutions will require the attention and consensus of the participants in those networks.
At Trail of Bits, Dan Guido says he thinks cryptocurrencies and blockchain have a promise, but anybody investing in them should consider them to be still in the ""prototype"" stage.
""Everybody needs to know kind of what they're buying, what they're buying into — what they're going to trust,"" Guido says. ""And there's a lot here that you should not trust. At least, not today."""

Over 50% of Bitcoin addresses still in profit,"The Bitcoin bear market has not yet cost hodlers dear enough, BTC wallet balance data suggests.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/that-s-not-hodling-over-50-of-bitcoin-addresses-still-in-profit,"More than half of Bitcoin (BTC) addresses are still in profit, raising questions about the severity of the current “bear market.”
Data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode confirms that as of June 20, 56.2% of addresses were still worth more in United States dollar terms than when their coins entered them.
Profitability fails to match previous market bottoms
As BTC/USD fell to 19-month lows of $17,600 over the weekend, analysts braced for what they assume will turn out to be a retracement of up to 84.5% from all-time highs.
A sense of confusion reigns this year thanks to those highs not being “high enough” compared with historical bull market tops.
The subsequent drawdown has thus taken many by surprise, despite so far not matching previous bear markets.
The Glassnode figures support that idea. BTC price bottoms have tended to coincide with less than half of addresses remaining in profit, and as such, the current downtrend still has a way to go if it is to fit in with historical patterns.
In March 2020, for instance, profitable addresses dropped to 41%, and before that, the 2018 bear market also saw a drop below the 50% mark.

Panic, however, may already be setting in. As Cointelegraph reported, realized losses have been mounting among hodlers too uneasy about babysitting their funds any longer.

Market “getting closer” to the big short
On the topic of how much selling needs to take place before the market reverses, Dylan LeClair, senior analyst at UTXO Management, eyed a split between retail and derivatives traders.

In times gone by, he argued this week, retail has sold first and speculators come in to finish the process by shorting BTC to unnaturally low levels.

This is the June 2022 monthly market insights report by Bitcoin.com Exchange. In this and subsequent reports, expect to find a summary of crypto market performance, a macro recap, market structure analysis, and more.
Crypto Market Performance
Crypto markets continued on a downtrend as BTC and ETH were down 30% and 44% respectively over the last 30 days.
The macroeconomic outlook continues to be unfavorable for risk assets as high inflation combines with elevated commodity prices and tight U.S. labor market conditions. Adding to that, crypto has experienced a credit crisis as major borrow/lend players such as Celsius, 3AC, and Babel Finance have gone insolvent.
Despite the big losses seen on BTC and ETH, some large cap assets have held strong. Out of the top 50 assets by market cap, Helium performed most positively, gaining 33% over the last 30 days. LEO was up 11.20% and LINK remained practically unchanged. The largest underperformance was seen by AVAX which was down 44%, Bitcoin Cash (down 39%), and Cronos (down 40%).
Macro Recap: Commodities Pressure Despite Central Banks Actions
In the latest FOMC meeting, for the first time since 1994, the U.S. Federal Reserve increased rates by 75 basis points. This was on the back of continued high CPI data, which came in at 8.1% for May 2022 (the highest since 1981). Labor conditions in the U.S. remain tight as April numbers (released on June 1) showed job openings came down only slightly to 11.4M after posting record highs of 11.8M for March. Chairman Powel hinted at another rate hike of between 50 to 75 bps, which would be announced in the FOMC’s July 2022 meeting.
As central banks tighten, supply chain issues combined with political instability continue to push commodities prices higher. Oil led the way, with light oil futures reaching $120 USD per barrel before stabilizing above $105 in the latest trading sessions. Supply/demand continues to balance towards higher demand. Despite some demand destruction from high oil prices, the supply chain constraints due to sanctions against Russian exports have kept supply tight.
Market Structure: Forced Capitulation A Sign Of Local Bottom?
BTC markets have seen two forced sell offs of significant size in a month’s time span. First was the liquidation of assets by Luna Foundation, which sold up to 80,000 BTC, along with considerable sums of ETH and other liquid assets. Second was the credit crisis and liquidation of Celsius, 3AC, and Babel Finance. Crypto market capitalization dropped by $2.1T from the all-time-highs reached in November 2021.
This has put pressure on miners, who are also facing increased electricity costs. As prices continue to declinem, we can see that the profitability for miners diminishes. According to Glassnode’s difficulty regression model, the “all-in sustaining cost” of mining currently sits at $17,800, which is approximately where BTC traded last weekend.
With Bitcoin’s hashrate already down 10% from its all-time-high, it seems unprofitable miners are already going offline.
One can argue that as profitability decreases, miners will become forced sellers. The Puell Multiple (PM), shown in orange in the chart below, is an oscillator which tracks the revenue generated by miners. The PM is showing a value of 0.35, which equates to revenues 61% below the yearly average. This is close to the levels seen in the 2014/2015 and 2018/2019 bear markets. At that time, miners saw a PM multiple of 0.31, which equated to a 69% revenue decline vs the yearly average.
The Difficulty Ribbon Compression (DRC), shown in purple in the above chart, is a miner’s stress model. It indicates mining rigs going offline. Mining rigs going offline happens for many reasons. These include regulatory considerations, increasing difficulty of the Bitcoin algorithm, increasing electricity costs, and of course decreasing profitability due to lower market prices. In the above chart, we can see a decrease in this metric, which indicates that less rigs are active due to one or more of the reasons mentioned.
Next, we will look at the Long Time Holders (LTH) cohort. As market participants capitulate, LTHs come under stress. As shown below, the LTH cohort has seen a total supply decrease of 178K BTC over the last month, which accounts for 1.31% of the total holdings of this group.
Another interesting metric to understand the status of the current sell off is the old supply being revived. As can be seen below, about 20-36K BTC are currently being revived per day, which is similar to levels seen in April 22. This indicator can be viewed as a fear index, as it shows the need for long-term holders to sell their positions due to the current conditions.
Lastly, we will look at the inflows and outflows from centralized exchanges, also known as the netflow exchange balance. When we see market inflow to exchanges, we can assume market participants are looking to sell their tokens. When we see market outflow from exchanges, we can assume market participants are looking to hold their tokens.
Below we can notice a strong market inflow in May 2022 on the back of the LUNA crash, with inflows reaching +4% per week (exchange balance). This was similar to the 2018-2019 sell off (>1% of exchange balance inflows).
In the latest sell off (June), however, we notice an outflow of 2.8% per week. This can be attributed to the uniqueness of the sell off. As the creditworthiness of some of the largest crypto players came into question, participants may have been driven to move their tokens to self-custody, where there is less perceived risk.
In summary, the market experienced back-to-back sell offs in May and June 2022. Although these were precipitated by strong macroeconomic headwinds, two black-swan events (namely the LUNA crash and the insolvency of 3AC and other big players) may have caused overselling. This may indicate that we have already seen a local bottom. In the long-term, however, it’s likely that the macro picture will continue to have a strong influence on the markets.

It has fallen more than 70 percent since its November 2021 all-time high of $69,000 and is currently trading at $20,501.
This is a slight recovery from the sell-off on June 14, 2022, which saw BTC test the $17,700 mark for the first time in years. While this has spelt nothing but pain for Bitcoin investors, critics have had a field day during the meltdown.
Bill Gates recently came out against cryptos and NFTs, even saying he would short Bitcoin ""if there was an easy way to do it"". Other critics predicted further pain for the world's oldest cryptocurrency.
Internationally recognized financial analyst, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital Inc and noted Bitcoin opponent, Peter Schiff, surprised the crypto industry with a tweet predicting that BTC would stoop to a low of $3,000 in the future.
""If #Bitcoin can collapse by 70% from $69,000 to under $21,000, it can just as easily fall another 70% down to $6,000. Given the excessive leverage in #crypto, imagine the forced sales that would take place during a sell-off of this magnitude. $3,000 is a more likely price target,"" he tweeted.

The phrase 'Bitcoin is Dead' is also gaining momentum on the internet. Data from Google Trends shows that online searches for 'Bitcoin dead' hit an all-time high after BTC dropped below the $18,000 mark.
However, crypto enthusiasts were quick to refute these claims, highlighting the previous 400-plus instances wherein people called for the death of Bitcoin. Yes, that's right — in its short lifetime, Bitcoin has had 452 obituaries on the crypto news and learning platform, 99Bitcoins.
Each of these obituaries represents a write-up on the internet that says Bitcoin is or will be worthless in the future. And remember, 99Bitcoins only considers content produced by noteworthy figures and sites with substantial traffic for this statistic.
It's not just enthusiasts backing the cryptocurrency. Several on-chain metrics also point to a Bitcoin resuscitation. One of them is the 200-week moving average (MA), which has historically functioned as a solid level of support for Bitcoin.
Previously, Bitcoin has bounced back and taken off every time it has hit the 200-week MA. This happened in 2015, 2019 and 2020, as shown in the graph below:
The price of Bitcoin tends to briefly dip below its 200-week MA and then slowly work its way up, starting a new uptrend. This is an encouraging sign, given that BTC is trading very close to its 200-week MA after short stints below it. Also, based on previous patterns, BTC could dip below the 200-week MA, but not too far below and not for too long.
Besides the 200-week moving average, the market-value-to-realized-value ratio (MVRV) suggests that the worst is behind us, and the current lull is not likely to persist for the long term. This means it is the perfect time to buy the dip and start accumulating BTC.
Let’s look at the chart to get a better idea:
Bitcoin’s MVRV score has dipped only twice in the last four years. First in 2018 and then later in March 2020. If this pattern continues, the price of BTC might fall briefly, but an upward trend should follow.
Even if the prices drop, experts have pointed out several historic support levels that Bitcoin could fall back on. In December 2020, BTC hit a support level of $21,900 before climbing to $41,000. Bitcoin’s historic performance also indicates $19,900 and $16,500 as additional support levels should BTC fall below $20,000, as it has in the last few weeks.
So, as you can see, there is plenty of reason to believe that Bitcoin is not dead. Moreover, judging by these on-chain metrics, Bitcoin should see an upward swing in the future.

It has been estimated that in order for bitcoin miners to remain profitable, Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world. No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology. In fact, we’ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John’s.One could now argue that Bitcoin has now a global brand because of how everyone recognizes it even if they don’t really know what it is.Added to that, Bitcoin also has the largest market cap and liquidity pool which is why many find it to be the most attractive coin out there. Bitcoin summed up· Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating with no type of central control nor oversight from banks or governments, relying solely on its cryptography and peer-to-peer software.· A public ledger keeps track of all transactions by recording them. Copies are then held around the world on servers called nodes (which anyone can set up) and consensus is thus achieved on the state of the network.· Every single transaction is broadcasted publicly to the network and then shared between nodes. Miners lump these together into groups called blocks and add them permanently to the blockchain, Bitcoin’s definitive account book.· May 22 is known as the Bitcoin Pizza Day, marking the anniversary of BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real companyHow Does Bitcoin Work? Bitcoin is a completely neutral and decentralized asset which means no one is controlling it (no bankers or oligarchs pulling strings behind the curtain), and no central entity can issue or back it. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender in El Salvador and as it makes its way into our every day lives, other countries might soon follow suit. Bitcoin uses cryptography to assure its safety and reliability. Bitcoin transactions are verified by a process called mining which basically runs on computing power to solve mathematical puzzles. When trading Bitcoin its name is often abbreviated as BTC. What is a Blockchain Bitcoin’s system can be described as a group of computers (often called miners or nodes) which stores the Bitcoin blockchain and runs the Bitcoin code. The blockchain itself can be visualized as a string of blocks and within every block one can find immutable information, usually a collection of transactions, that are permanently recorded and which everyone can look into. Given that all of the Bitcoin network’s computers are running the exact same list of blocks, participants are assured of the process transparency because the ledger is maintained safely in this decentralized database. This makes it so that no trusted third party is necessary, and no single person is in control, rather all network participants are. As new information comes along, a freshly added block is minted and added to the blockchain while other nodes verify the whole thing. P2P Explained Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is meant to make instant payments easier. Bitcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement P2P and its system shifts the responsibility of processing the blockchain transactions to Bitcoin miners while giving them rewards for doing so. Bitcoin miners act as a decentralized authority which enforces the Bitcoin network’s credibility by performing these tasks and maintaining the Bitcoin ledger. The best-known case for the success of peer-to-peer BTC transactions probably lies in countries like Venezuela and El Salvador in which the younger generations have made strides in the coin’s mass adoption in their respective countries. How Does Bitcoin Make Money? Many people are still purchasing Bitcoins for the asset’s investment value rather than its capabilities of being used as a medium of exchange. As such, the asset has a speculative side which cannot be ignored due to how it correlates with its price volatility. How To Get Bitcoin? How to get into Bitcoin is a fairly easy process. Aside from the Bitcoin mining process, the asset can be exchanged for standard currencies even though it is not backed by any form of government or central entity like a bank. The Bitcoin exchange rate against the US Dollar keeps attracting investors and traders. Luckily, even the uninitiated won’t be needing a “bitcoin for dummies” guide because the asset is normally bought through a Bitcoin exchange to which you can wire money or simply pay with your credit card. Just remember to look for BTC (BTC meaning is obviously Bitcoin but there are altcoins which might try to pose as the original). Bitcoin Mining: How Are Bitcoins Created? Bitcoins are created through a process which is open for everyone to participate known as Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining consists of solving mathematical puzzles by means of one’s computational power, meaning that mining systems will in fact compete with one another for the asset. How Do I Start Mining Bitcoin? Even though the bitcoin digital world welcomes all with open arms, mining new bitcoins isn’t really a Bitcoin for beginners type of thing. If you want to venture into mining Bitcoins, the most obvious entry barriers are the expensive ASIC systems which you will need and the high electrical bills they will run up. ASIC stands for application-specific integrated chip. Bitcoin ASIC systems are custom bitcoin mining machines and are unquestionably one of the largest investments for bitcoin miners given that prices start at 4 figures and miners organize thousands of these into their mining pools (one ASIC system alone will potentially generate less than one single bitcoin). Network infrastructure may also be an issue as miners will need uninterrupted internet access with the least possible latency. The Bitcoin mining process has thus turned into a costly endeavor with no guaranteed results. Bitcoin Security Explained Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which is distributed in a peer-to-peer network, making it very resistant to censorship and confiscation. Bitcoin technology boasts its safety by relying on several factors such as its blockchain, the fact that it is cryptographic, decentralized, and permissionless. Being public and decentralized boosts the asset’s security as nodes verify every transaction and maintain the ledger. As such, theoretically, one would need to control over half of all the nodes to be able to manipulate it, something which albeit not impossible is certainly highly unlikely. How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin has been growing at a steady pace and some brick-and-mortar merchants have begun to accept it as means of payment for goods and services. Online, the asset has also found its way as an accepted online payment option on pair with credit cards or Paypal. How to Buy Bitcoin Buying Bitcoin is a straightforward process. A buyer will simply need to pick a broker, opt for a paying option (wiring money, credit card, etc.), place an order, and select a safe storage option for his or her coins. Keep in mind that you should be looking for Bitcoin or BTC and not things like “Bit coin” or “bitcoin cryptocurrency” because there have been known scams and fake coins, so stick with reputable brokers. Where Can I Buy Bitcoin? Buying Bitcoin is mostly done through Bitcoin brokers, many of which will ask you for your KYC data (know your customer data: name, address, and so forth). As such, some concerns were raised over the asset’s security and user anonymity, which is why non-KYC options were also created. However, non-KYC Bitcoin buying might not be entirely legal depending on where the buyer lives. Storing your Bitcoins There are different ways of storing your Bitcoins. Regarded as the safest way of holding Bitcoin, an offline wallet (also known as cold storage or hardware wallet) is usually the go-to option for most people because of how these Bitcoin wallets are not accessible through the Internet and thus keep the asset safe offline. By not being connect to the internet, cold wallets have a much smaller risk of being compromised. However, some will prefer to store the asset in hot wallets which run on internet-connected devices (phones, computers, etc.). Investing in Bitcoin Why Is Bitcoin Valuable? Scarcity is an important element to why Bitcoin has value. Having unlimited supply will obviously not translate to being a good store of value. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million. Another factor to consider is that the asset is being considered by many as “freedom money” given that it cannot be inflated away, nor can it be censored or confiscated. This makes it self-evident that Bitcoins are standing above concepts like sovereignty, user’s personal preferences, creeds, and so forth. Moreover, the monetary policy some of the newer crypto projects out there can be altered at a moment’s notice, whereas Bitcoin’s monetary policy was fixed at its inception, meaning that it is a much steadier asset than any of its other digital counterparts. Can Bitcoin be converted to cash? Bitcoin can be converted to cash through third-party broker exchanges. The process requires the seller to deposit his or her Bitcoins into the exchange and, once verification that the asset was received takes place, a withdrawal request for fiat currency can be made. The money will then be wired into the sellers account and usually the broker will require you to use the same account which is connected to it (as to prevent money laundering schemes). Another less used method one can resort to are peer-to-peer selling platforms.There are at least 3 things to consider before cashing out your Bitcoin: taxes, fees, and speed Bitcoin Investing Risks Every investment comes with risk. Bitcoin, albeit being a digital asset, is no different. In fact, there are some risks you should know about when dealing with BTC. Regulatory risk Decentralization comes at a price. As Bitcoin makes great strides into our everyday lives and begins to be recognized as legal tender, it inherently becomes a competitor to fiat, or government currency. Obviously, it can (and many are certain that it already has) become a digital medium for illegal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and other underground market payments. This makes it clear that governments will look into either regulate, restrict, or even attempt to ban its use and/or sale. Other efforts might include actively enforcing KYC requirements to brokers or having participants reporting transactions over a certain amount. Regardless, the lack of Bitcoin regulation, especially in a uniformed manner, will certainly make some weary about its longevity and universality. Security risk As the Bitcoin mining process barriers of entry get higher and higher, it comes as no surprise that many Bitcoin holders will have acquired it by resorting to one of the many available online exchanges. As it happens with everything digital, these exchanges are also risk prone either by malware, glitches or even hackers. If a hacker takes over one’s computer and manages to get his or her hands on a private encryption key, they will be easily able to steal Bitcoin (and remember, Bitcoin transactions are permanent and there is no insurance or refunds). The exchanges themselves are honeypots due to how some of their users simply aren’t resorting to holding their Bitcoin in safer places. Insurance risk Bitcoin accounts and exchanges are usually not insured in any way. However, some exchanges have begun to provide Bitcoin insurance to its investors, namely with FDIC insurance for a portion of transactions which involve cash. Fraud risk Bitcoin encryption through private keys allows for ownership verification and transactions to be registered. However, there have been known cases of scammers attempting to sell fake Bitcoin or operating Bitcoin Ponzi schemes. Market risk Bitcoin value fluctuates and cryptocurrency volatility is a quite common occurrence in the digital crypto sphere. As such, Bitcoin price swings are to be expected. As an example of how extreme things can go, Bitcoin fell about 80% in one single day in 2014. People have brought up the subject of the Bitcoin bubble time and time again, but the truth is that the project is holding on despite having plenty of competitors. So, Is Bitcoin a Good Investment? A good investment can be defined in many ways. Bitcoin investments can greatly vary due to how some people interpret it as a speculative short-term play while others see it as a hedge against inflation or aim for long-term adoption and appreciation. It will come down to one’s own perception and assessment of the investment’s risk and reward. What Are the Issues with Bitcoin? Volatility is still and issue with Bitcoin as is the lack of true anonymity. However, the main issue with the digital asset is as its popularity keeps growing, it becomes slower and slower, cumbersome, and, more importantly, expensive to use. Transactions take a long time to be validated and fees have skyrocketed, meaning that Bitcoin is slowly walking a path in which might lead to its unviability as medium of exchange. Electricity consumption has also been a source of concern. The History: Who created Bitcoin? While some people still believe that there is someone who owns Bitcoin, the truth is that Bitcoin has had a somewhat immaculate conception in the world of finance. It is a unique historical “accident” that one might say it would probably be impossible to recreate (as many of the newer digital projects have unfortunately shown us). Anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto (who can either be an individual or group of individuals) left the project very early on and as we all know every prominent cryptocurrency creator who sticks around can be turned into a single point of failure of the project, meaning that taking credit for the project could in fact hurt it. Moreover, Bitcoins value was near zero for a long time given despite having first mover advantage. That got to fly under the radar of both the public and the regulators unlike the newer projects out there. When Was Bitcoin Created? The Bitcoin white paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the original software which runs the asset was released the following year. Bitcoin Forking History Throughout Bitcoin’s history there have been some accounts of disagreement between miners and developers with even factions being created. These led to significant splits in the community which surrounds crypto and the asset, some of which led to the point in which a “fork” had to be performed on the network. Forking happens as developers or miners believe that a significant change must be made in the network’s protocol.In this particular case, the process led to the creation of a new type of Bitcoin with a completely different name. If the new coin is set to share the previous coin’s transaction history up to the split point, the process is considered to be a “hard fork”. Bitcoin Cash (launched in August 2017), Bitcoin Gold (launched in October 2017), and Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (launched in November 2018) were all a result of a hard fork in Bitcoin’s network. If the fork, however, allows for the protocol to remain compatible with its previous iteration, that it is known as a “soft fork”. Bitcoin’s functionalities like SegWit are a result of soft forks in the network. What is Bitcoin Concluded While some believe Bitcoin to be the future of currency, others see it as a speculative play. Regardless of how people see Bitcoin, the decentralized aspect of the project completely revolutionized finance and the world itself much akin to how gold overcame seashells many, many centuries ago. With no central control or oversight from governments or banks, Bitcoin is inessence an unbelievably strong social consensus with a monetary policy written in stone and a max supply which can be compared to a religious dogma. FAQ Can Bitcoin be Considered a Real Currency? Bitcoin is referred to by many as a form of digital currency and/or the main alternative to fiat money which is controlled by central entities such as banks. Bitcoin differs due to how no monetary authority can issue it and, as we know, currencies offer value due to their ability to operate as a store of value and, obviously, as a unit of exchange. People who aren’t digitally native or who can’t go beyond the concept of fiat currency may still wonder what do bitcoins look like but there are other countries which have made great strides into adapting themselves to this new currency. Countries like El Salvador, for example, have recognized it as legal tender, which means that if you ask someone over there questions like how to get into bitcoin, what is bitcoin and how does it work, they’ll have the answer on the tip of their tongue even if they don’t know bitcoins definition. The revolution might have just begun, and we might see Bitcoin being used on a daily basis much like credit cards. Why do people want Bitcoins? The reasons why people want Bitcoins can greatly vary. While some believe it will be the currency of the future, assuming that we’re going digital on all fronts, others just use it for speculative plays and quick profits. What makes Bitcoin a new kind of money? Mainly, what makes Bitcoin a new kind of money is its digital, decentralized nature. Many crypto enthusiasts call Bitcoin “freedom money”. Your bank accounts can be frozen, your licenses can even be revoked, the list goes on. If a government has immunity over their actions and is able freeze your assets on just the slight suspicion of wrongdoing (or if they find out you don’t support their “regime”) then it might be the time to do so and start looking at Bitcoin differently because they can try and try again but no one will be able to fully stop peer-to-peer bitcoin or lightning transactions to and from non-custodial wallets, meaning people will still be able to receive and send bitcoins as they please. What is the purpose of Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s original purpose was to provide a way for people to be able to send money over the internet and to provide a digital, decentralized alternative in what concerns payment systems. This is the main reason why some people out there love bitcoin more than cash. How Many Bitcoins Are There? By design, Bitcoins supply is hard capped at 21 million, meaning that its supply is finite.After the asset’s supply reaches 21 million, no additional coins will be generated. Is Bitcoin a Scam? Bitcoin is intangible but its value is certainly real and its presence in the financial world is robust and longstanding. With that being said, there are scammers out there who will try to swindle people with nefarious tactics and scams. Nonetheless, these problems are rooted in human behavior and not in the coin itself. The digital asset’s code is open source, and anyone can download and review it. Can you buy a house with Bitcoin? Buying a house with Bitcoins or another digital crypto asset is certainly a very real possibility. To do so, one should look for a real estate agency which has experience dealing with Bitcoins and crypto transactions. However, keep in mind that a mortgage on the property might not be possible due to how some banks are still hesitant on the asset. Even if the coin is world famous now, there are still many places where you’ll be asked what is btc. However, if the seller will accept Bitcoin, the only thing left is to negotiate the selling price in BTC. Who controls Bitcoin price? Bitcoin is not issued by an entity like a central bank, nor it is backed by a government. Accordingly, monetary policy, and other measurements of economic growth simply do not apply when dealing with Bitcoins. However, its price can still be influenced by a variety of factors like the digital asset’s supply, the market’s demand, the cost of producing it, the miners’ rewards, regulations regarding the asset’s sale and use, news developments, competing crypto, and so forth. How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin? The length it takes can vary depending on the block reward’s amount (how much will crypto miners will receive for generating a new block).It is estimated that on average a new block is produced every 10 minutes, meaning that a new Bitcoin gets mined approximately every 1.6 minutes. Is mining Bitcoin illegal? The legality of this process will most likely solely depend on your geographic location. As Bitcoin threatens fiat currencies’ dominance and governmental control, the digital asset has been declared to be completely illegal in some countries. With that being said, ownership and the coin’s mining process are still legal in many more countries than not. While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world. No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology. In fact, we’ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John’s.One could now argue that Bitcoin has now a global brand because of how everyone recognizes it even if they don’t really know what it is.Added to that, Bitcoin also has the largest market cap and liquidity pool which is why many find it to be the most attractive coin out there. Bitcoin summed up· Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating with no type of central control nor oversight from banks or governments, relying solely on its cryptography and peer-to-peer software.· A public ledger keeps track of all transactions by recording them. Copies are then held around the world on servers called nodes (which anyone can set up) and consensus is thus achieved on the state of the network.· Every single transaction is broadcasted publicly to the network and then shared between nodes. Miners lump these together into groups called blocks and add them permanently to the blockchain, Bitcoin’s definitive account book.· May 22 is known as the Bitcoin Pizza Day, marking the anniversary of BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real companyHow Does Bitcoin Work? Bitcoin is a completely neutral and decentralized asset which means no one is controlling it (no bankers or oligarchs pulling strings behind the curtain), and no central entity can issue or back it. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender in El Salvador and as it makes its way into our every day lives, other countries might soon follow suit. Bitcoin uses cryptography to assure its safety and reliability. Bitcoin transactions are verified by a process called mining which basically runs on computing power to solve mathematical puzzles. When trading Bitcoin its name is often abbreviated as BTC. What is a Blockchain Bitcoin’s system can be described as a group of computers (often called miners or nodes) which stores the Bitcoin blockchain and runs the Bitcoin code. The blockchain itself can be visualized as a string of blocks and within every block one can find immutable information, usually a collection of transactions, that are permanently recorded and which everyone can look into. Given that all of the Bitcoin network’s computers are running the exact same list of blocks, participants are assured of the process transparency because the ledger is maintained safely in this decentralized database. This makes it so that no trusted third party is necessary, and no single person is in control, rather all network participants are. As new information comes along, a freshly added block is minted and added to the blockchain while other nodes verify the whole thing. P2P Explained Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is meant to make instant payments easier. Bitcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement P2P and its system shifts the responsibility of processing the blockchain transactions to Bitcoin miners while giving them rewards for doing so. Bitcoin miners act as a decentralized authority which enforces the Bitcoin network’s credibility by performing these tasks and maintaining the Bitcoin ledger. The best-known case for the success of peer-to-peer BTC transactions probably lies in countries like Venezuela and El Salvador in which the younger generations have made strides in the coin’s mass adoption in their respective countries. How Does Bitcoin Make Money? Many people are still purchasing Bitcoins for the asset’s investment value rather than its capabilities of being used as a medium of exchange. As such, the asset has a speculative side which cannot be ignored due to how it correlates with its price volatility. How To Get Bitcoin? How to get into Bitcoin is a fairly easy process. Aside from the Bitcoin mining process, the asset can be exchanged for standard currencies even though it is not backed by any form of government or central entity like a bank. The Bitcoin exchange rate against the US Dollar keeps attracting investors and traders. Luckily, even the uninitiated won’t be needing a “bitcoin for dummies” guide because the asset is normally bought through a Bitcoin exchange to which you can wire money or simply pay with your credit card. Just remember to look for BTC (BTC meaning is obviously Bitcoin but there are altcoins which might try to pose as the original). Bitcoin Mining: How Are Bitcoins Created? Bitcoins are created through a process which is open for everyone to participate known as Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining consists of solving mathematical puzzles by means of one’s computational power, meaning that mining systems will in fact compete with one another for the asset. How Do I Start Mining Bitcoin? Even though the bitcoin digital world welcomes all with open arms, mining new bitcoins isn’t really a Bitcoin for beginners type of thing. If you want to venture into mining Bitcoins, the most obvious entry barriers are the expensive ASIC systems which you will need and the high electrical bills they will run up. ASIC stands for application-specific integrated chip. Bitcoin ASIC systems are custom bitcoin mining machines and are unquestionably one of the largest investments for bitcoin miners given that prices start at 4 figures and miners organize thousands of these into their mining pools (one ASIC system alone will potentially generate less than one single bitcoin). Network infrastructure may also be an issue as miners will need uninterrupted internet access with the least possible latency. The Bitcoin mining process has thus turned into a costly endeavor with no guaranteed results. Bitcoin Security Explained Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which is distributed in a peer-to-peer network, making it very resistant to censorship and confiscation. Bitcoin technology boasts its safety by relying on several factors such as its blockchain, the fact that it is cryptographic, decentralized, and permissionless. Being public and decentralized boosts the asset’s security as nodes verify every transaction and maintain the ledger. As such, theoretically, one would need to control over half of all the nodes to be able to manipulate it, something which albeit not impossible is certainly highly unlikely. How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin has been growing at a steady pace and some brick-and-mortar merchants have begun to accept it as means of payment for goods and services. Online, the asset has also found its way as an accepted online payment option on pair with credit cards or Paypal. How to Buy Bitcoin Buying Bitcoin is a straightforward process. A buyer will simply need to pick a broker, opt for a paying option (wiring money, credit card, etc.), place an order, and select a safe storage option for his or her coins. Keep in mind that you should be looking for Bitcoin or BTC and not things like “Bit coin” or “bitcoin cryptocurrency” because there have been known scams and fake coins, so stick with reputable brokers. Where Can I Buy Bitcoin? Buying Bitcoin is mostly done through Bitcoin brokers, many of which will ask you for your KYC data (know your customer data: name, address, and so forth). As such, some concerns were raised over the asset’s security and user anonymity, which is why non-KYC options were also created. However, non-KYC Bitcoin buying might not be entirely legal depending on where the buyer lives. Storing your Bitcoins There are different ways of storing your Bitcoins. Regarded as the safest way of holding Bitcoin, an offline wallet (also known as cold storage or hardware wallet) is usually the go-to option for most people because of how these Bitcoin wallets are not accessible through the Internet and thus keep the asset safe offline. By not being connect to the internet, cold wallets have a much smaller risk of being compromised. However, some will prefer to store the asset in hot wallets which run on internet-connected devices (phones, computers, etc.). Investing in Bitcoin Why Is Bitcoin Valuable? Scarcity is an important element to why Bitcoin has value. Having unlimited supply will obviously not translate to being a good store of value. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million. Another factor to consider is that the asset is being considered by many as “freedom money” given that it cannot be inflated away, nor can it be censored or confiscated. This makes it self-evident that Bitcoins are standing above concepts like sovereignty, user’s personal preferences, creeds, and so forth. Moreover, the monetary policy some of the newer crypto projects out there can be altered at a moment’s notice, whereas Bitcoin’s monetary policy was fixed at its inception, meaning that it is a much steadier asset than any of its other digital counterparts. Can Bitcoin be converted to cash? Bitcoin can be converted to cash through third-party broker exchanges. The process requires the seller to deposit his or her Bitcoins into the exchange and, once verification that the asset was received takes place, a withdrawal request for fiat currency can be made. The money will then be wired into the sellers account and usually the broker will require you to use the same account which is connected to it (as to prevent money laundering schemes). Another less used method one can resort to are peer-to-peer selling platforms.There are at least 3 things to consider before cashing out your Bitcoin: taxes, fees, and speed Bitcoin Investing Risks Every investment comes with risk. Bitcoin, albeit being a digital asset, is no different. In fact, there are some risks you should know about when dealing with BTC. Regulatory risk Decentralization comes at a price. As Bitcoin makes great strides into our everyday lives and begins to be recognized as legal tender, it inherently becomes a competitor to fiat, or government currency. Obviously, it can (and many are certain that it already has) become a digital medium for illegal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and other underground market payments. This makes it clear that governments will look into either regulate, restrict, or even attempt to ban its use and/or sale. Other efforts might include actively enforcing KYC requirements to brokers or having participants reporting transactions over a certain amount. Regardless, the lack of Bitcoin regulation, especially in a uniformed manner, will certainly make some weary about its longevity and universality. Security risk As the Bitcoin mining process barriers of entry get higher and higher, it comes as no surprise that many Bitcoin holders will have acquired it by resorting to one of the many available online exchanges. As it happens with everything digital, these exchanges are also risk prone either by malware, glitches or even hackers. If a hacker takes over one’s computer and manages to get his or her hands on a private encryption key, they will be easily able to steal Bitcoin (and remember, Bitcoin transactions are permanent and there is no insurance or refunds). The exchanges themselves are honeypots due to how some of their users simply aren’t resorting to holding their Bitcoin in safer places. Insurance risk Bitcoin accounts and exchanges are usually not insured in any way. However, some exchanges have begun to provide Bitcoin insurance to its investors, namely with FDIC insurance for a portion of transactions which involve cash. Fraud risk Bitcoin encryption through private keys allows for ownership verification and transactions to be registered. However, there have been known cases of scammers attempting to sell fake Bitcoin or operating Bitcoin Ponzi schemes. Market risk Bitcoin value fluctuates and cryptocurrency volatility is a quite common occurrence in the digital crypto sphere. As such, Bitcoin price swings are to be expected. As an example of how extreme things can go, Bitcoin fell about 80% in one single day in 2014. People have brought up the subject of the Bitcoin bubble time and time again, but the truth is that the project is holding on despite having plenty of competitors. So, Is Bitcoin a Good Investment? A good investment can be defined in many ways. Bitcoin investments can greatly vary due to how some people interpret it as a speculative short-term play while others see it as a hedge against inflation or aim for long-term adoption and appreciation. It will come down to one’s own perception and assessment of the investment’s risk and reward. What Are the Issues with Bitcoin? Volatility is still and issue with Bitcoin as is the lack of true anonymity. However, the main issue with the digital asset is as its popularity keeps growing, it becomes slower and slower, cumbersome, and, more importantly, expensive to use. Transactions take a long time to be validated and fees have skyrocketed, meaning that Bitcoin is slowly walking a path in which might lead to its unviability as medium of exchange. Electricity consumption has also been a source of concern. The History: Who created Bitcoin? While some people still believe that there is someone who owns Bitcoin, the truth is that Bitcoin has had a somewhat immaculate conception in the world of finance. It is a unique historical “accident” that one might say it would probably be impossible to recreate (as many of the newer digital projects have unfortunately shown us). Anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto (who can either be an individual or group of individuals) left the project very early on and as we all know every prominent cryptocurrency creator who sticks around can be turned into a single point of failure of the project, meaning that taking credit for the project could in fact hurt it. Moreover, Bitcoins value was near zero for a long time given despite having first mover advantage. That got to fly under the radar of both the public and the regulators unlike the newer projects out there. When Was Bitcoin Created? The Bitcoin white paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the original software which runs the asset was released the following year. Bitcoin Forking History Throughout Bitcoin’s history there have been some accounts of disagreement between miners and developers with even factions being created. These led to significant splits in the community which surrounds crypto and the asset, some of which led to the point in which a “fork” had to be performed on the network. Forking happens as developers or miners believe that a significant change must be made in the network’s protocol.In this particular case, the process led to the creation of a new type of Bitcoin with a completely different name. If the new coin is set to share the previous coin’s transaction history up to the split point, the process is considered to be a “hard fork”. Bitcoin Cash (launched in August 2017), Bitcoin Gold (launched in October 2017), and Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (launched in November 2018) were all a result of a hard fork in Bitcoin’s network. If the fork, however, allows for the protocol to remain compatible with its previous iteration, that it is known as a “soft fork”. Bitcoin’s functionalities like SegWit are a result of soft forks in the network. What is Bitcoin Concluded While some believe Bitcoin to be the future of currency, others see it as a speculative play. Regardless of how people see Bitcoin, the decentralized aspect of the project completely revolutionized finance and the world itself much akin to how gold overcame seashells many, many centuries ago. With no central control or oversight from governments or banks, Bitcoin is inessence an unbelievably strong social consensus with a monetary policy written in stone and a max supply which can be compared to a religious dogma. FAQ Can Bitcoin be Considered a Real Currency? Bitcoin is referred to by many as a form of digital currency and/or the main alternative to fiat money which is controlled by central entities such as banks. Bitcoin differs due to how no monetary authority can issue it and, as we know, currencies offer value due to their ability to operate as a store of value and, obviously, as a unit of exchange. People who aren’t digitally native or who can’t go beyond the concept of fiat currency may still wonder what do bitcoins look like but there are other countries which have made great strides into adapting themselves to this new currency. Countries like El Salvador, for example, have recognized it as legal tender, which means that if you ask someone over there questions like how to get into bitcoin, what is bitcoin and how does it work, they’ll have the answer on the tip of their tongue even if they don’t know bitcoins definition. The revolution might have just begun, and we might see Bitcoin being used on a daily basis much like credit cards. Why do people want Bitcoins? The reasons why people want Bitcoins can greatly vary. While some believe it will be the currency of the future, assuming that we’re going digital on all fronts, others just use it for speculative plays and quick profits. What makes Bitcoin a new kind of money? Mainly, what makes Bitcoin a new kind of money is its digital, decentralized nature. Many crypto enthusiasts call Bitcoin “freedom money”. Your bank accounts can be frozen, your licenses can even be revoked, the list goes on. If a government has immunity over their actions and is able freeze your assets on just the slight suspicion of wrongdoing (or if they find out you don’t support their “regime”) then it might be the time to do so and start looking at Bitcoin differently because they can try and try again but no one will be able to fully stop peer-to-peer bitcoin or lightning transactions to and from non-custodial wallets, meaning people will still be able to receive and send bitcoins as they please. What is the purpose of Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s original purpose was to provide a way for people to be able to send money over the internet and to provide a digital, decentralized alternative in what concerns payment systems. This is the main reason why some people out there love bitcoin more than cash. How Many Bitcoins Are There? By design, Bitcoins supply is hard capped at 21 million, meaning that its supply is finite.After the asset’s supply reaches 21 million, no additional coins will be generated. Is Bitcoin a Scam? Bitcoin is intangible but its value is certainly real and its presence in the financial world is robust and longstanding. With that being said, there are scammers out there who will try to swindle people with nefarious tactics and scams. Nonetheless, these problems are rooted in human behavior and not in the coin itself. The digital asset’s code is open source, and anyone can download and review it. Can you buy a house with Bitcoin? Buying a house with Bitcoins or another digital crypto asset is certainly a very real possibility. To do so, one should look for a real estate agency which has experience dealing with Bitcoins and crypto transactions. However, keep in mind that a mortgage on the property might not be possible due to how some banks are still hesitant on the asset. Even if the coin is world famous now, there are still many places where you’ll be asked what is btc. However, if the seller will accept Bitcoin, the only thing left is to negotiate the selling price in BTC. Who controls Bitcoin price? Bitcoin is not issued by an entity like a central bank, nor it is backed by a government. Accordingly, monetary policy, and other measurements of economic growth simply do not apply when dealing with Bitcoins. However, its price can still be influenced by a variety of factors like the digital asset’s supply, the market’s demand, the cost of producing it, the miners’ rewards, regulations regarding the asset’s sale and use, news developments, competing crypto, and so forth. How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin? The length it takes can vary depending on the block reward’s amount (how much will crypto miners will receive for generating a new block).It is estimated that on average a new block is produced every 10 minutes, meaning that a new Bitcoin gets mined approximately every 1.6 minutes. Is mining Bitcoin illegal? The legality of this process will most likely solely depend on your geographic location. As Bitcoin threatens fiat currencies’ dominance and governmental control, the digital asset has been declared to be completely illegal in some countries. With that being said, ownership and the coin’s mining process are still legal in many more countries than not. Read this Term must trade at $21,000 the very least. As the price broke below $20,000 not long ago, there was an effort by key figures in the financial sector (such as Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey) to intensify the selling.

Bitfarms Liquidated Almost 50% of Its BTC
Bitfarms released a statement on its website that it sold almost 50% of its BTC holdings (3,000 Bitcoin for approximately $62 million). Jeff Lucas, the CFO of Bitfarms said: ""In consideration of extreme volatility in the markets, we have continued to take action to enhance liquidity and to de-leverage and strengthen our balance sheet.
""Specifically, we sold 1,500 more Bitcoin and are no longer HODLing all our daily BTC production.
""While we remain bullish on long-term BTC price appreciation, this strategic change enables us to focus on our top priorities of maintaining our world-class mining operations and continuing to grow our business in anticipation of improved mining economics.
“Since January 2021, we have been funding operations and growth through various financing measures. We believe that selling a portion of our BTC holdings and daily production as a source of liquidity Liquidity The term liquidity refers to the process, speed, and ease of which a given asset or security can be converted into cash. Notably, liquidity surmises a retention in market price, with the most liquid assets representing cash. The most liquid asset of all is cash itself. · In economics, liquidity is defined by how efficiently and quickly an asset can be converted into usable cash without materially affecting its market price. · Nothing is more liquid than cash, while other assets represent varying degrees of liquidity. This can be differentiated as market liquidity or accounting liquidity.· Liquidity refers to a tangible construct that can be measures. The most common ways to do so include a current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio. What is the Definition of Liquidity? Liquidity is a common definition used in investing, banking, or the financial services space. Its primary function is to ascertain how quickly a given asset can be bought, sold, or exchanged without a disparity in market price. Which of the following assets is the most liquid? By definition, in terms of liquidity, cash is unequivocally seen as the most liquid asset in an economic sense. This is due to its widespread acceptance and ease of conversion into other assets, forms of cash, or currencies, etc. All other liquid assets must be able to be quickly and efficiently converted into cash, i.e., financial liquidity. This includes such things as stocks, commodities, or virtually any other construct that has an associated value. By extension, illiquid or non-liquid assets are not able to be quickly converted into cash. These assets, also known as tangible assets, can include such things as rare art or collectables, real estate, etc. Liquidity Spectrum Liquid assets can be defined primarily as either cash on hand or simply an asset that can be easily or readily converted into usable cash. It is important to note that cash is not uniformly liquid for several reasons. The below examples encompass all types of assets and their corresponding level of liquidity. Examples of Liquid Assets or Securities A good example of this is the US dollar, which is recognized or accepted globally, and backed by the US government or Federal Reserve Bank. Other major forms of cash include Euros, or major currencies. This differs notably from the legal tender in many emerging countries or others for political or economic reasons. Cash aside, assets such as stocks or equities, bonds and other securities, money market assets, marketable securities, US treasuries or T-notes, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a savings account, and mutual funds serve as the most liquid assets. These are generally assumed to be quick assets. Each of these assets can be converted into cash either instantaneously, or via any brokerage platform, exchange, etc., often in as little as minutes or seconds. As such, these assets are liquid. Examples of Illiquid Assets or Securities Conversely, illiquid assets still retain importance and value, though are much more difficult to convert into cash. Common examples of this include land or real estate, intellectual property, or other forms of capital such as equipment or machinery. In the examples above, liquid assets are assumed to be convertible into cash without substantial fees or delays in time. Illiquid assets on the other hand often suffer from fees or additional conversion costs, processing times, ultimately creating a price disparity. The best example of an illiquid asset is a house. For many individuals this is the most valuable asset they will own in their entire lives. However, selling a house typically requires taxes, realtor fees, and other costs, in addition to time. Real estate or land also takes much longer to exchange into cash, relative to other assets. Types of Liquidity Overall, liquidity is a broad term that needs to be defined by two different measures: market liquidity and accounting liquidity. Both measures deal with different constructs or entities entirely, though are useful metrics with regards to individuals or financial markets. Market Liquidity Market liquidity is a broader term that is used by a market maker to measure the ease of which assets can be bought and sold at transparent prices, namely across exchanges, stock markets, or other financial sectors. This can include among others, a real estate or property market, market for fine arts and collectable, and other goods. Market Liquidity Example As mentioned above, certain financial markets are much more liquid than others. The degree to which stocks from large companies or foreign currencies can be exchanged is much easier than finding a readily available market for antiques, collectables, or other capital, regardless of utility. Overall, a stock market, financial brokerage, or exchange is considered to have the high market liquidity. This is because the difference between both the bid and ask prices between parties is very low. The lower the spread between these two prices, the more liquid a given market is. Additionally, low liquidity refers to a higher spread between two prices. Why Liquidity Varies and What Does Liquidity Mean in Stocks? Every asset has a variable level of liquidity meaning this can change depending on what is being analyzed. One can define liquidity in stocks or stock markets in the same way as in foreign exchange markets, brokers, commodities exchanges, and crypto exchanges. Additionally, how large the market is will also dictate liquidity. The foreign exchange market for example is currently the largest by trading volume with high liquidity due to cash flows. This is hardly surprising given that forms of cash or currencies are being exchanged. What is Liquidity in Stocks? A stock's liquidity refers to how rapidly shares of a stock can be bought or sold without largely impacting a stock price. By definition, liquidity in stocks varies for a number of reasons. Stocks with low liquidity may be difficult to sell and may cause you to take a bigger loss if you cannot sell the shares when you want to. In finance, the most liquid assets are always the most popular. By extension, if a spread between buyers and sellers increases, the market is considered to be less liquid. A good example of this is the real estate or property market. While highly valuable, there are large disparities between the purchase price and selling price of property, as well as the time associated in making these transactions, and additional fees incurred by other parties. Liquidity providers play a key role in this regard. Accounting Liquidity Unlike market liquidity, accounting liquidity measures something different entirely. Accounting liquidity is a measure by which either an individual or entity can meet their respective current financial obligations with the current liquid assets available to them. This includes paying off debts, overhead, or any other fixed costs associated with a business. Accounting liquidity is a functional comparison between one’s current liquid assets and their current liabilities. In the United States and other countries, companies and individuals have to reconcile accounting on a yearly basis. Accounting liquidity is an excellent measure that captures financial obligations due in a year. Accounting Liquidity Example Accounting liquidity itself can be differentiated by several ratios, controlling for how liquid assets are. These measures are useful tools for not just the individual or company in focus but for others that are trying to ascertain current financial health.As an example, accounting liquidity can measure any company’s current financial assets and compare them to its financial obligations. If there is a large disparity between these figures, or much more assets than obligations, a company can be considered to have a strong depth of liquidity.How to Calculate Liquidity Liquidity is of importance to investors, financial market participants, analysts, or even for an investment strategy. Calculating liquidity is a measure of firm or individual’s ability to utilize or harness current liquid assets to current cover short-term debt. This can be achieved using a total of four formulas: the current ratio, quick ratio, acid-test variation, and cash ratio. Current Ratio The current ratio is the easiest measure due to its lack of complexity. Quite simply, the current ratio measures a firm or individual’s current assets or those than can be sold within a calendar year, weighed against all current liabilities. Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities If the current ratio’s value is greater than 1, then the entity in question can be assumed to reconcile its financial obligations using its current liquid assets. Highly liquid assets will correspond to higher numbers in this regard. Conversely, any number less than 1 indicates that current liquid assets are not enough to cover short-term obligations. Quick Ratio A quick ratio is a slightly more complex way of measuring accounting liquidity via a balance sheet. Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio excludes current assets that are not as liquid as cash, cash equivalents, or other shorter-term investments. The quick ratio can be defined below by the following: Quick Ratio = (Cash or Cash Equivalents + Shorter-Term Investments + Accounts Receivable)/Current Liabilities Acid-Test Ratio The acid-test ratio is a variation of the quick ratio. The acid-test ratio seeks to deduct inventory from current assets, serving as a traditionally broader measure that is more forgiving to individuals or entities. Acid-Test Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventories – Prepaid Costs)/Current Liabilities Cash Ratio Finally, the cash ratio further isolates current assets, looking to measure only liquid assets that are designated as cash or cash equivalents. In this sense, the cash ratio is the most precise of the other liquidity ratios, excluding accounts receivable, inventories, or other assets. A more precise measure has its uses, namely regarding assessing financial strength in the face of an emergency, i.e., an unforeseen and time sensitive event. The cash ratio can help measure an entity or individual’s hypothesized solvency in the face of unexpected scenarios, events, etc. As such, the cash ratio is defined below: Cash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents/Current Liabilities The cash ratio is not simply a doomsday tool but a highly practical measure when determining market value. In the financial services space, even large companies or profitable institutions can find themselves at liquidity risk due to unexpected events beyond their control. Why is Liquidity Important and Why it Matters to You? Liquidity is very important for not just financial markets but for individuals and investors. Liquid markets benefit all market participants and make it easier to buy and sell securities, stocks, collectables, etc. On an individual level, this is important for personal finance, as ordinary investors are able to better take advantage of trading opportunities. Additionally, high liquidity promotes financial health in companies in the same way it does for individuals. Conclusion – What Does Liquidity Mean? What is liquidity? This metric is a commonly used as a measure in the investing, banking, or financial services space. Liquidity determines how quickly a given asset can be bought, sold, or exchanged without a disparity in market price. Which of the following assets is the most liquid? – cash, stocks, real estate. Of all assets, cash or money is the most liquid, meaning it is the easiest to utilize. All other liquid assets must be able to be quickly and efficiently converted into cash. This includes such things as stocks, commodities, or virtually any other construct that has an associated value. Conversely, illiquid or non-liquid assets are not able to be quickly converted into cash. These assets, also known as tangible assets, can include such things as rare art or collectables, real estate, etc. Frequently Asked Questions About Liquidity Is Liquidity Good or Bad? The term liquidity refers to a measure and is neither good nor bad but is instead a metric of how convertible an asset is to cash. However, high liquidity is associated with lower risk, while a liquid stock is more likely to keep its value when being traded.Is a Home a Liquid Asset? A home or properly is not considered to be a liquid asset. Selling any property can incur additional costs and take a long amount of time. Additionally, there is often a price disparity from the time of purchase, meaning a seller may not even get its original market value back at the time of the sale. Why Are Stocks Liquid? Stocks are some of the most liquid assets in financial markets because these assets can be converted to cash in a short period of time in the event of any financial emergency. Is Tesla a Liquid Stock? Tesla is a liquid stock and while hugely volatile, is an integral part of the NASDAQ and is a globally recognized company. Additionally, the company is a popular single-stock CFD offering at many brokerages, with very high volumes. Is a Pension a Liquid Asset? Certain pensions are liquid assets once you have reached a retirement age. Until you are eligible to withdraw or collect a pension, without early withdrawal penalty, it is not considered a liquid asset. The term liquidity refers to the process, speed, and ease of which a given asset or security can be converted into cash. Notably, liquidity surmises a retention in market price, with the most liquid assets representing cash.

By definition, in terms of liquidity, cash is unequivocally seen as the most liquid asset in an economic sense. This is due to its widespread acceptance and ease of conversion into other assets, forms of cash, or currencies, etc. All other liquid assets must be able to be quickly and efficiently converted into cash, i.e., financial liquidity. This includes such things as stocks, commodities, or virtually any other construct that has an associated value. By extension, illiquid or non-liquid assets are not able to be quickly converted into cash. These assets, also known as tangible assets, can include such things as rare art or collectables, real estate, etc. Liquidity Spectrum Liquid assets can be defined primarily as either cash on hand or simply an asset that can be easily or readily converted into usable cash. It is important to note that cash is not uniformly liquid for several reasons. The below examples encompass all types of assets and their corresponding level of liquidity. Examples of Liquid Assets or Securities A good example of this is the US dollar, which is recognized or accepted globally, and backed by the US government or Federal Reserve Bank. Other major forms of cash include Euros, or major currencies. This differs notably from the legal tender in many emerging countries or others for political or economic reasons. Cash aside, assets such as stocks or equities, bonds and other securities, money market assets, marketable securities, US treasuries or T-notes, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a savings account, and mutual funds serve as the most liquid assets. These are generally assumed to be quick assets. Each of these assets can be converted into cash either instantaneously, or via any brokerage platform, exchange, etc., often in as little as minutes or seconds. As such, these assets are liquid. Examples of Illiquid Assets or Securities Conversely, illiquid assets still retain importance and value, though are much more difficult to convert into cash. Common examples of this include land or real estate, intellectual property, or other forms of capital such as equipment or machinery. In the examples above, liquid assets are assumed to be convertible into cash without substantial fees or delays in time. Illiquid assets on the other hand often suffer from fees or additional conversion costs, processing times, ultimately creating a price disparity. The best example of an illiquid asset is a house. For many individuals this is the most valuable asset they will own in their entire lives. However, selling a house typically requires taxes, realtor fees, and other costs, in addition to time. Real estate or land also takes much longer to exchange into cash, relative to other assets. Types of Liquidity Overall, liquidity is a broad term that needs to be defined by two different measures: market liquidity and accounting liquidity. Both measures deal with different constructs or entities entirely, though are useful metrics with regards to individuals or financial markets. Market Liquidity Market liquidity is a broader term that is used by a market maker to measure the ease of which assets can be bought and sold at transparent prices, namely across exchanges, stock markets, or other financial sectors. This can include among others, a real estate or property market, market for fine arts and collectable, and other goods. Market Liquidity Example As mentioned above, certain financial markets are much more liquid than others. The degree to which stocks from large companies or foreign currencies can be exchanged is much easier than finding a readily available market for antiques, collectables, or other capital, regardless of utility. Overall, a stock market, financial brokerage, or exchange is considered to have the high market liquidity. This is because the difference between both the bid and ask prices between parties is very low. The lower the spread between these two prices, the more liquid a given market is. Additionally, low liquidity refers to a higher spread between two prices. Why Liquidity Varies and What Does Liquidity Mean in Stocks? Every asset has a variable level of liquidity meaning this can change depending on what is being analyzed. One can define liquidity in stocks or stock markets in the same way as in foreign exchange markets, brokers, commodities exchanges, and crypto exchanges. Additionally, how large the market is will also dictate liquidity. The foreign exchange market for example is currently the largest by trading volume with high liquidity due to cash flows. This is hardly surprising given that forms of cash or currencies are being exchanged. What is Liquidity in Stocks? A stock's liquidity refers to how rapidly shares of a stock can be bought or sold without largely impacting a stock price. By definition, liquidity in stocks varies for a number of reasons. Stocks with low liquidity may be difficult to sell and may cause you to take a bigger loss if you cannot sell the shares when you want to. In finance, the most liquid assets are always the most popular. By extension, if a spread between buyers and sellers increases, the market is considered to be less liquid. A good example of this is the real estate or property market. While highly valuable, there are large disparities between the purchase price and selling price of property, as well as the time associated in making these transactions, and additional fees incurred by other parties. Liquidity providers play a key role in this regard. Accounting Liquidity Unlike market liquidity, accounting liquidity measures something different entirely. Accounting liquidity is a measure by which either an individual or entity can meet their respective current financial obligations with the current liquid assets available to them. This includes paying off debts, overhead, or any other fixed costs associated with a business. Accounting liquidity is a functional comparison between one’s current liquid assets and their current liabilities. In the United States and other countries, companies and individuals have to reconcile accounting on a yearly basis. Accounting liquidity is an excellent measure that captures financial obligations due in a year. Accounting Liquidity Example Accounting liquidity itself can be differentiated by several ratios, controlling for how liquid assets are. These measures are useful tools for not just the individual or company in focus but for others that are trying to ascertain current financial health.As an example, accounting liquidity can measure any company’s current financial assets and compare them to its financial obligations. If there is a large disparity between these figures, or much more assets than obligations, a company can be considered to have a strong depth of liquidity.How to Calculate Liquidity Liquidity is of importance to investors, financial market participants, analysts, or even for an investment strategy. Calculating liquidity is a measure of firm or individual’s ability to utilize or harness current liquid assets to current cover short-term debt. This can be achieved using a total of four formulas: the current ratio, quick ratio, acid-test variation, and cash ratio. Current Ratio The current ratio is the easiest measure due to its lack of complexity. Quite simply, the current ratio measures a firm or individual’s current assets or those than can be sold within a calendar year, weighed against all current liabilities. Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities If the current ratio’s value is greater than 1, then the entity in question can be assumed to reconcile its financial obligations using its current liquid assets. Highly liquid assets will correspond to higher numbers in this regard. Conversely, any number less than 1 indicates that current liquid assets are not enough to cover short-term obligations. Quick Ratio A quick ratio is a slightly more complex way of measuring accounting liquidity via a balance sheet. Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio excludes current assets that are not as liquid as cash, cash equivalents, or other shorter-term investments. The quick ratio can be defined below by the following: Quick Ratio = (Cash or Cash Equivalents + Shorter-Term Investments + Accounts Receivable)/Current Liabilities Acid-Test Ratio The acid-test ratio is a variation of the quick ratio. The acid-test ratio seeks to deduct inventory from current assets, serving as a traditionally broader measure that is more forgiving to individuals or entities. Acid-Test Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventories – Prepaid Costs)/Current Liabilities Cash Ratio Finally, the cash ratio further isolates current assets, looking to measure only liquid assets that are designated as cash or cash equivalents. In this sense, the cash ratio is the most precise of the other liquidity ratios, excluding accounts receivable, inventories, or other assets. A more precise measure has its uses, namely regarding assessing financial strength in the face of an emergency, i.e., an unforeseen and time sensitive event. The cash ratio can help measure an entity or individual’s hypothesized solvency in the face of unexpected scenarios, events, etc. As such, the cash ratio is defined below: Cash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents/Current Liabilities The cash ratio is not simply a doomsday tool but a highly practical measure when determining market value. In the financial services space, even large companies or profitable institutions can find themselves at liquidity risk due to unexpected events beyond their control. Why is Liquidity Important and Why it Matters to You? Liquidity is very important for not just financial markets but for individuals and investors. Liquid markets benefit all market participants and make it easier to buy and sell securities, stocks, collectables, etc. On an individual level, this is important for personal finance, as ordinary investors are able to better take advantage of trading opportunities. Additionally, high liquidity promotes financial health in companies in the same way it does for individuals. Conclusion – What Does Liquidity Mean? What is liquidity? This metric is a commonly used as a measure in the investing, banking, or financial services space. Liquidity determines how quickly a given asset can be bought, sold, or exchanged without a disparity in market price. Which of the following assets is the most liquid? – cash, stocks, real estate. Of all assets, cash or money is the most liquid, meaning it is the easiest to utilize. All other liquid assets must be able to be quickly and efficiently converted into cash. This includes such things as stocks, commodities, or virtually any other construct that has an associated value. Conversely, illiquid or non-liquid assets are not able to be quickly converted into cash. These assets, also known as tangible assets, can include such things as rare art or collectables, real estate, etc. Frequently Asked Questions About Liquidity Is Liquidity Good or Bad? The term liquidity refers to a measure and is neither good nor bad but is instead a metric of how convertible an asset is to cash. However, high liquidity is associated with lower risk, while a liquid stock is more likely to keep its value when being traded.Is a Home a Liquid Asset? A home or properly is not considered to be a liquid asset. Selling any property can incur additional costs and take a long amount of time. Additionally, there is often a price disparity from the time of purchase, meaning a seller may not even get its original market value back at the time of the sale. Why Are Stocks Liquid? Stocks are some of the most liquid assets in financial markets because these assets can be converted to cash in a short period of time in the event of any financial emergency. Is Tesla a Liquid Stock? Tesla is a liquid stock and while hugely volatile, is an integral part of the NASDAQ and is a globally recognized company. Additionally, the company is a popular single-stock CFD offering at many brokerages, with very high volumes. Is a Pension a Liquid Asset? Certain pensions are liquid assets once you have reached a retirement age. Until you are eligible to withdraw or collect a pension, without early withdrawal penalty, it is not considered a liquid asset.

Google Organic Search for Bitcoin Spikes
As organic search for Bitcoin has been dwindling over the past couple of months, the crypto crash injected renewed interest in Bitcoin. Organic search for 'Bitcoin' reached 100/100 on google trends.

El Salvador, Netherlands, Nigeria, Switzerland, Austria and Turkey are among the top countries that searched for Bitcoin. Organic search tends to increase during firm price movements.
In this instance, investors may experience Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) due to BTC and ETH rebounding off their lows.
Crypto Winter, Job Layoffs
The fear of a chilly crypto winter made several crypto exchanges to act as a precaution. Coinbase announced that it will cut 18% of its global workforce, which is approximately 1,100 jobs.
The crypto exchange is expected to retain around 5,000 employees by the end of June 2022. Additionally, Coinbase reported it saw a decline of 19% in its active monthly users in Q1 2022 due to a rapid decline in cryptocurrencies' prices.
Vauld, a cryptocurrency exchange backed by Coinbase in Singapore announced it is cutting its workforce by 30%. Most of Valud's employees are based in India. Darshan Bathija, the Co-Founder and CEO at Vauld wrote a post on the company's blog that ""Vauld continues to operate as usual despite volatile market conditions.""
Moreover, Bathija highlighted that the exchange has no exposure to Celsius or Three Arrows Capital and ""all withdrawals were processed as usual, and this will continue to be the case in the future.""
Further, Valud will reduce marketing expenses and halve executive compensation. Gemini is also skimming 10% of its employees, and Crypto.com will cut 5% of workforce.

Bitcoin trading volumes are up on multiple exchanges including Kraken and Bitstamp. While some may argue that these are Bitcoin short liquidations, volumes remain firm during BTC bullish rebound (at the time of writing).
On top of that, Ether is enjoying strong volumes across the exchanges. The layoffs may be related to recession fears in the US. Many companies (not related to cryptocurrencies/tokens) had already reduced their staff.
During the 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis, many turned to trading/investing in various financial products. Extraordinary volatility often unveils opportunities.
Although the cryptocurrency markets are still relatively new compared to stocks or forex, a similar concept may be applied.
Binance and Lbank affirmed that they are continuing to hire, 'against the trend' of reducing staff ahead of a potential recession. The effects of these announcements reassure investors that the exchanges are well-financed and are positioned to tackle hurdles that may occur.
Also, it may draw talent to these exchanges as opposed to others. It will be unsurprising if executive figures will depart from Coinbase and Gemini to join Binance or Lbank.
Crypto Ads Spending Cut
Following Bitcoin price drop from over $60,000 to $20,000 (approx.), crypto exchanges have dialed down their marketing spending. The Wallstreet Journal (WSJ) estimated that spending was cut by over 90% by the top crypto companies (including TV ads).
Crypto.com spending in May was $2.1 million compared to $15 million in November 2021. Gemini spending dropped to $478,000 in May from $3.8 million in November.
However, not all companies have trimmed their marketing budget. FTX is estimated to have spent $5 million in May compared to $3 million in November.
It is quite surprising to see significant spending cuts. Bitcoin appears to be presented as a 'winning horse' that only gains attraction when it 'wins'. When the horse is short of breath and underperforms, it is deemed as an unattractive.
The majority of investors are aware that a dip in a highly-valued asset may be an opportunity, which is backed by large BTC holders netflow.

It may be possible that well-capitalized companies are not slicing their spending budget. As long as the market remains volatile, traders are likely to participate. However, when the price is held in a tight range, some may prefer to stake their holdings.
The Next 'Hot' Sector and Conclusions
Bitcoin miners need to learn from oil rigs companies how to act and prepare for price fluctuations. Hiring during a bear market may demonstrate the financial strength and stability of the company.
Interest in cryptocurrencies is highly correlated to price fluctuations. The next dominant sector that may rise over time, in my opinion, is the metaverse or more accurately metaverse real estate.
As the top cryptocurrencies have weakened significantly, bargain hunters may attempt to increase their exposure to the virtual real estate market.
source: google trends
Trading volumes are still firm despite the 'crypto crash'. In the event the US enters a recession at the end of the year, Bitcoin may 'de-peg' from the US markets and claim a safe-haven status.
Hiring during a bear market may signal the strength of the company in its ability to withstand extreme market conditions. Chopping the marketing budget in a phase that may attract more traders/investors into the crypto markets may not achieve its goals.
The new GBP stablecoin may be available as soon as July.
Acquisitions may blossom. Gripped by panic, companies may offer their project for sale at a fairly competitive price. Uniswap Labs, a popular decentralized exchange (DEX) recently acquired Genie, an NFT marketplace aggregator. The size of the acquisition is undisclosed at the time of this writing.
USD trading volumes for NFT purchases has dropped by more than 66 percent in the past 30 days. It increases the odds Genie was acquired at an attractive price should NFT volumes surge over the next 12 months.
The next major event aside from central banks is the ETH merge (due in August) and ADA hard fork (postponed to the last week July). Tether announcing a new stablecoin that is pegged to GBP may also contribute to ETH as it will initially be available on the ETH Mainnet."

The deteriorating market conditions have also affected Bitcoin (BTC) mining profitability adversely, forcing miners to liquidate their BTC holdings.
New data from Arcane research shows that public Bitcoin mining firms sold 100% of their BTC production in May compared to the usual 20-40% earlier.
In the first four months of 2022, public BTC mining firms sold 30% of their mined production, which increased 3X folds in May and is expected to rise even further in June.
While public BTC miners only make up to 20% of the total network hashrate, their behavior often reflects the sentiments of private miners as well.

The condition has only worsened in June with the Bitcoin price falling below the 2017 high of $20,000 and recording a new 4-year low of $17,783. Miner’s to exchange flow, a data metric that shows the volume of BTC sent by miners onto exchanges has reached a new high in June, reaching a level not seen since January 2021.
As Cointelegraph reported earlier, BTC miner’s to exchange flow ratio has hit a new 7-month high when BTC price tanked below $21,000. The decline in the price of BTC has also made many mining machines unprofitable, forcing miners to leave the crypto market.
Bitcoin hash price is a mining metric that represents the miner revenue on a per terahash basis. It is the average value — in fiat currency — of the daily rewards a miner gets per each terahash calculation (USD/TH/s per day), which has fallen to a new 1.5-year low.
Bitcoin Hash Ribbon, an indicator that tries to identify periods where BTC miners are in distress and may be capitulating, has crossed, indicating many miners are unplugging their machines due to lack of profitability.
At a time of BTC price decline and miner crisis, many believe it is a strong price bottom signal as well, especially when miners start giving up.

But Saylor’s words have rung hollow in the weeks since then, as Bitcoin has crashed alongside so many other facets of the U.S. economy. For years, cryptocurrency advocates have touted Bitcoin as a hedge against the inflating value of fiat currencies. Historically, Bitcoin has even seen popular adoption in foreign countries experiencing widespread economic instability like El Salvador, Lebanon, and Venezuela. But with inflation surging to its highest level since 1982 everything from gas to groceries is more expensive than it’s been in decades. And as the U.S. dollar declines in value, investment in Bitcoin has experienced a steep dropoff: For weeks, the cryptocurrency has consistently hovered around $20,000, a lofty plunge from its historic high of $68,000 just seven months ago. (It even plunged to $17,592 at one point over the weekend, its lowest point since December 2020.)

Bitcoin isn’t soaring during the current period of growing inflation shows that it still has a long way to go before it catches up with the vision of its top advocates, even despite widespread institutional investment. The reality is that, for the average retail investor, Bitcoin is still a highly speculative investment providing little value in the real world. “When inflation goes up, there are other things that are changing, and Bitcoin is not resilient to all [this change],” said Itay Goldstein, a professor of economics and finance at Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Coupled with inflation is the fall of the financial markets which “is bringing down Bitcoin as well,” he continued. Beyond Bitcoin, cryptocurrency at large has been plagued by turmoil in recent weeks. In early June, the controversial cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius froze as much as $8 billion worth of transactions due to what the company described as “extreme market conditions.” The move has sparked a regulatory investigation that could lead to a wider market crackdown when it comes to federal regulation regarding cryptocurrency investment.

The uncertain economic forecast has affected top cryptocurrency companies, many of which are bracing for an upcoming “crypto winter.” Both Coinbase and Gemini laid off employees in mid-June, with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong writing in a blog post that “economic conditions are changing rapidly” into what appears to be an impending recession, which could in turn into another crypto winter. Not only has this defensive position had a chilling effect on the cryptocurrency market at large, but it’s served as an indication that Bitcoin is subject to the rules of bear and bull markets. Bitcoin is often compared to gold because of the limited amount that can be produced, but in reality, it has more closely paralleled the performance of tech stocks. (In fact,gold has been outperforming Bitcoin in terms of dollar investment in the past year.)
advertisement
Money sapped from the financial markets has a big effect on Bitcoin , said Goldstein. “A lot of things that were keeping financial markets up were also helping cryptocurrencies,” he said. “People put money into cryptocurrencies as speculation, and these are the same people speculating on stocks. When the mood changes, they’re becoming more pessimistic.” Today, Bitcoin still functions like a high risk investment, especially in times of economic turmoil. More than any other fiat currency, Bitcoin crucially depends on investor sentiment for its value: the more people who believe in it and buy in, the higher the price, and vice versa. Because its value is so inextricably linked to investor sentiment, it’s still a poor inflation hedge, especially during periods of economic turmoil. A shaky economic future means that fewer people are less inclined to dump their savings in risky investments, even if those same investments might someday counter a swiftly inflating fiat currency."

Find out more about the nation's Bitcoin stance now.,https://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/bitcoin-will-go-to-zero-chinese-government-warning-02509722,"The crypto market has been in freefall for the past few months. Now, China has once again entered the fray stating in Economic Daily, a government publication, that the value of Bitcoin (BTC) could be “heading to zero”
China vs Crypto
China frequently makes headlines for its tough stance on digital currencies with the nation “banning” Bitcoin on multiple occasions and frequently attempting to crack down on mining operations.
In the Economic Daily report, the west was blamed for creating a highly-leveraged market that is “full of manipulation and pseudo-technology concepts”, which the publication claimed was an “important external factor” contributing to Bitcoin’s volatility.
In another statement from the publication, it claimed “Bitcoin is nothing more than a string of digital codes, and its returns mainly come from buying low and selling high”.
The publication also claimed, “In the future, once investors’ confidence collapses or when sovereign countries declare Bitcoin illegal, it will return to its original value, which is utterly worthless.” The Chinese government has always been against cryptocurrency, with the nation banning foreign exchanges in 2018, and mining in June 2021, before fully outlawing cryptocurrency in September 2021.
Buy Bitcoin
Cryptoassets are a highly volatile unregulated investment product. Your capital is at risk.
Digital Chinese Yuan (e-CNY)
Despite warnings that the price of Bitcoin is going to zero, China has big plans for its own digital currency based on the Chinese Yuan.
According to the e-CNY website, the Digital Yuan is set to “replace the dollar and USDT including all other stable coins”. Furthermore, it was stated that e-CNY is the “best crypto with 1000x potential”. From these statements, it seems as though China could be sowing doubt in regards to Bitcoin in order to better promote its own cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin Going to Zero
It seems unlikely that Bitcoin is going to zero. Ultimately, the asset’s value is based on supply and demand, so for it to reach $0 every holder would have to sell and nobody could buy bitcoin. Of course, in the wild west of crypto, anything is possible so it’s always important to do your own research before investing.
Bitcoin is currently down around 70% from all-time highs, causing a crisis of confidence amongst many holders. Therefore, China’s statements couldn’t have come at a worse time. However, Bitcoin has previously weathered multiple bans in China so it’s unlikely these statements will have too much of a negative impact in the long run.

508,2022-06-23,2022-06-23,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Yashu Gola,cointelegraph.com,On the brink of recession: Can Bitcoin survive its first global economic crisis?,Bitcoin has not seen a single full-blown recession in its lifetime but analysts see it surviving one after suffering more blows.,https://cointelegraph.com/news/on-the-brink-of-recession-can-bitcoin-survive-its-first-global-economic-crisis,"Bitcoin (BTC) was a response to the 2008 global recession. It introduced a new way to transact without depending on the trust of third parties, such as banks, particularly failing banks that were nevertheless bailed out by the government at the expense of the public.
""The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust,"" Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in 2009.
Bitcoin's genesis block sums up the intent with the following embedded message:
""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.""
But while Bitcoin keeps mining blocks unfazed, and its gold-like properties have attracted investors seeking ""digital gold,"" its current 75% comedown from $69,000 highs in November 2021 demonstrates that its not immune to global economic forces.
Simultaneously, the entire crypto market lost $2.25 trillion in the same period, hinting at large-scale demand destruction in the industry.
Bitcoin's crash appeared during the period of rising inflation and the global central banks' hawkish response to it. Notably, the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark rates by 75 basis points (bps) on June 15 to curb inflation that reached 8.4% in May.

Furthermore, the crash left BTC trending even more in-sync with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's performance. The U.S. stock market index fell over 30% between November 2021 and June 2022.
More rate hikes ahead
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted in his Congressional testimony that their rate hikes would continue to bring down inflation, albeit adding that ""the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.""
The statement followed Reuters' poll of economists, which agreed that the Fed would raise benchmark rates by another 75 bps in July and will follow it up with a 0.5% increase in September.
That adds more downside potential to an already-declining crypto market, noted Informa Global Markets, a London-based financial intelligence firm, saying that it would not bottom out until the Fed subsides its ""aggressive approach to monetary policy.""
But a U-turn on hawkish policies seems unlikely in the near term, given the central bank's 2% inflation target. Interestingly, the gap between the Fed's fund rates and the consumer price index (CPI) is now the largest on record.

Bitcoin faces first potential recession
Nearly 70% of economists believe that the U.S. economy will slip into a recession next year due to a hawkish Fed, according to a survey of 49 respondents conducted by the Financial Times.
To recap, a country enters a recession when its economy faces a negative gross domestic product (GDP), coupled with rising unemployment levels, declining retail sales and a lower manufacturing output for an extended period of time.
Notably, about 38% expect the recession to begin in the first half of 2023, while 30% anticipate the same to happen during the Q3–Q4 session. Moreover, a separate survey conducted by Bloomberg in May shows a 30% possibility of recession next year.
The next recession in the U.S. will begin in 2023. Source: Financial Times
Powell also noted in his June 22 press conference that recession is ""certainly a possibility"" due to ""events of the last few months around the world,"" i.e., the Ukraine-Russia war, which has caused a food and oil crisis around the globe.
The predictions risk putting Bitcoin before a full-blown economic crisis. And the fact it has not behaved anything like a safe-haven asset during the period of rising inflation increases the probability that it will keep declining alongside the Wall Street indexes, primarily tech stocks.
Meanwhile, the collapse of Terra (LUNA, since renamed LUNC), a $40-billion ""algorithmic stablecoin"" project, which led to insolvency issues in Three Arrow Capital, the largest crypto hedge fund, has also destroyed demand across the crypto sector.
For instance, Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, dropped by more than 80% to $880 lows during the ongoing bear cycle.
Similarly, other top-ranking digital assets, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), plunged in the range of 85% to over 90% from their 2021 peaks.
""The crypto house is on fire, and everyone is just, you know, rushing to the exits because there's just completely lost confidence in the space,"" said Edward Moya, a senior markets analyst at OANDA, an online forex brokerage.
BTC bear markets are nothing new
Incoming bearish predictions for Bitcoin envision the price to break below its $20,000-support level, with Leigh Drogen, general partner and CIO at Starkiller Capital, a digital assets quantitative hedge fund, anticipating that the coin will reach $10,000, down 85% from its peak level.
However, there is little evidence for Bitcoin's total demise, especially after the coin's confrontation with six bear markets (based on its 20%-plus corrections) in the past, each leading to a rally above the previous record high.

Nick, an analyst at data resource Ecoinometrics, sees Bitcoin behaving like a stock market index, still in the ""middle of an adoption curve.""
Bitcoin is likely to drop further in a higher interest rate environment — similar to how the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 has dipped multiple times in the last 100 years — only to recover strongly.
Excerpts:
""Between 1929 and 2022, the S&P500 is up 200x. That’s something like a 6% annualized rate of return [...]. Some of those asymmetric bets are obvious and pretty safe, like buying Bitcoin now.""

Most altcoins will die
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about all the coins in the crypto market. Many of these so-called alternative cryptocurrencies, or ""altcoins,"" have dropped to their deaths this year, with some low-cap coins, in particular, logging over 99% price declines.

Nevertheless, projects with healthy adoption rates and real users could come out on top in the wake of a potential global economic crisis.
The top candidate to date is Ethereum, the leading smart contract platform, which dominates the layer-one blockchain ecosystem with over $46 billion locked across its DeFi applications.

Other chains, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana, Cardano and Avalanche, could also attract users as alternatives, ensuring demand for their underlying tokens.
Meanwhile, older altcoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) also have higher survival chances, particularly with speculation about possible Twitter integration in the pipeline.
Overall, a macro-led bear market will most likely hurt all digital assets across the board in the coming months.
But coins with lower market caps, dismissive liquidity and higher volatility will be at a higher risk of collapse, Alexander Tkachenko, founder and CEO at VNX, a digital gold dealer, told Cointelegraph. He added:
""If Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies want to get back to their full power, they need to become self-sufficient alternatives to fiat currencies, especially the U.S. dollar.""

The index, which estimates the amount of power used by Bitcoin miners, is maintained by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF). The CCAF estimates prices by determining a hypothetical maximum and minimum demand for a given day and produces a guess at actual consumption.
Over the same period, the Bitcoin price has slid 53% from $44,850 at the start of April to around $21,250 on Friday morning, according to CoinMarketCap.
If previous downturns are any indication, the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network could fall further still.
When prices slumped during the summer of 2021, they fell 50% from what was then a new all-time high of $63,558 on April 12 down to $29,796 on July 19. The power demand of the Bitcoin network lagged with it, but it took a few weeks for it to become apparent in the data.

Power demand for the Bitcoin network reached its 2021 peak in May, at an estimated 16 GW, according to the CBECI. And then, trailing weakened prices by a few weeks, estimated Bitcoin network power demand reached its lowest for the year on July 2, dropping 56% to 7 GW.
Of course, last year's price slump was compounded by a Bitcoin mining crackdown in China that forced companies either shut down or move their mining rigs to other countries.

Bitcoin miners brace for prolonged crypto winter
Now, there's evidence that Bitcoin miners have already started to prepare for a prolonged period of lower profits.
Publicly-traded Bitcoin miners, who need to disclose the sale of Bitcoin in their filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, sold more BTC in May than they mined, according to a report from Arcane Research.
For example, Toronto-based Bitfarms sold 3,000 BTC for $62 million last week. That was nearly half of the company's holdings. It said in a press release that as of June 20, it had $42 million cash on hand and 3,349 BTC worth approximately $67 million.
“Since January 2021, we have been funding operations and growth through various financing measures,"" said Bitfarms CFO Jeff Lucas in the press release. ""We believe that selling a portion of our BTC holdings and daily production as a source of liquidity is the best and least expensive method in the current market environment."""

In an update on June 24, Julio Moreno, senior analyst at on-chain data firm CryptoQuant, hinted that the BTC price bottom could now be due.
BTC price bottom “typically” follows miner capitulation
Miners have seen a dramatic change in circumstances since March 2020, going from unprecedented profitability to seeing their margins squeezed.
The dip to $17,600 — 70% below November’s all-time highs for BTC/USD — has hit some players hard, data now shows, with miner wallets sending large amounts of coins to exchanges.
This, CryptoQuant suggests, precedes the final stages of the Bitcoin sell-off more broadly in line with historical precedent.
“Our data demonstrate a miner capitulation event that has occurred, which has typically preceded market bottoms in previous cycles,” Moreno summarized.
Miner sales have been keenly tracked this month, with the Bitcoin Twitter account even describing the situation as miners “being drained of their coins.”

“For miners, it's time to decide to stay or leave,” CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, added in a Twitter thread last week.
The situation is tenuous, but the majority of miners remain active, as witnessed by network fundamentals dropping only slightly from all-time highs of over 30 trillion.

Mixed signals over buyer interest
When it comes to other large BTC holders, however, the picture appears less clear.

Trader and analyst Rekt Capital, nonetheless, reiterated doubts about the strength of overall buyer volume, arguing that sellers were conversely still directing market movements.
Bitcoin’s 200-week moving average (MA), a key support level during previous bear markets, has yet to see significant interest from buyers despite the spot price being around $2,000 below it.
“Current BTC buy-side volume following the extreme sell volume spike is still lower than the 2018 Bear Market buyer follow-through volume levels at the 200-week MA. Let alone March 2020 buy-side follow-through,” he told Twitter followers.

514,2022-06-24,2022-06-24,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,Alex Hern,www.theguardian.com,Electricity used to mine bitcoin plummets as crypto crisis widens,"Consumption down by third since 11 June, with even sharper falls among other cryptocurrency networks",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/24/electricity-consumption-mine-bitcoin-plummets-crypto-crisis-widens-cryptocurrency,"The amount of electricity consumed by the largest cryptocurrency networks has decreased by up to 50% as the “crypto winter” continues to eat at the incomes of “miners” and financial contagion spreads further throughout the sector.
The electricity consumption of the bitcoin network has fallen by a third from its high of 11 June, down to an annualised 131 terawatt-hours a year, according to estimates from the crypto analyst Digiconomist. That still equates to the annual consumption of Argentina, with a single conventional bitcoin transaction using the same amount of electricity that a typical US household would use over 50 days.
The decrease in electricity used for Ethereum, the “programmable money” that underpins much of the recent explosion in crypto projects, has been sharper still, down from a peak of 94TWh a year to 46TWh a year – the annualised consumption of Qatar.
The underlying reason for the fall is the same for both currencies, however. The electricity consumption of a cryptocurrency network comes from “mining”, which involves people using purpose-built computers to generate digital lottery tickets that can reward cryptocurrency payouts. The process underpins the security of the networks, but incentivises the network as a whole to waste extraordinary amounts of energy.
As the price of cryptocurrencies has fallen – bitcoin peaked at $69,000 (£56,000) earlier this year, and is now hovering at about $20,000 – the value of the rewards to miners has dropped by the same proportion, leaving those in areas with expensive electricity or using older, inefficient mining “rigs” unable to turn a profit.
“This is literally putting them out of business, starting with the ones that operate with suboptimal equipment or under suboptimal circumstances (eg inefficient cooling),” said Alex de Vries, the Dutch economist behind Digiconomist.
“For bitcoin mining equipment that’s a big issue, because those machines cannot be repurposed to do something else. When they’re unprofitable they’re useless machines. You can keep them around hoping the price will recover or sell them for scrap.”

Ethereum, by contrast, can be mined using a normal computer. But it is most profitable to do so using a very powerful graphics card, which has led to widespread supply shortages of the cards and turned many gamers against the industry. The collapse in mining revenue has led to a flood of graphics cards on the second-hand market, as insolvent miners try to recoup their investments, but De Vries warnsit is a lottery to buy one.
“These machines are typically operating 24/7 and the components will get hot doing so. Heat [especially for prolonged periods of time] is known to wear out electronics, reducing longevity and reliability.
“Right now it will mainly be older GPUs [graphics processing unit] becoming unprofitable, meaning that it’s not unlikely these devices have been used for mining for a long time.” Thankfully for gamers, the falling demand has also led to large price cuts for new components.
Although the fall in bitcoin’s price has stabilised over the past week, the wider cryptocurrency sector continues to stumble as a result of the huge price collapse. The latest jolt was caused by the failure of the ersatz cryptobank Celsius, which announced on 12 June that it was halting withdrawals as it faced a liquidity crisis.
The failure of Celsius triggered a domino effect across the wider sector: Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a multibillion-dollar hedge fund, experienced its own liquidity crunch as a result, and multiple companies with substantial outstanding loans to 3AC have now had to take emergency measures in turn.
Two other companies that offered bank-like services announced large exposures to 3AC. Last week Finblox said the hedge fund’s actions had an “effect on liquidity”, and heavily restricted user withdrawals, dropping the daily limit from $50,000 to $500 while stopping interest payments on deposits.
On Wednesday Voyager, which offers 12% on crypto deposits, revealed it had an outstanding loan of $650m to 3AC, more than four times its available cash. Voyager added that it would consider 3AC in default if the hedge fund did not repay the loan in full by Monday morning. The company has also reportedly frozen user withdrawals.
Bancor, a decentralised finance protocol that acts as an exchange, lost out to “the recent insolvency of two large centralised entities”, believed to be Celsius and 3AC, and had to impose withdrawal limits. On Thursday another crypto exchange, CoinFLEX, announced that it was pausing withdrawals because of “extreme market conditions”.
Amid the collapses, one large cryptocurrency company has emerged as a would-be saviour of the sector. Alameda Ventures, the investment arm of the crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, centred on his exchange FTX, has bailed out Voyager and the embattled exchange BlockFi, offering multimillion-dollar loans to both companies. The loans have earned him comparisons to JP Morgan, the US banker who stepped in during a 1907 financial crisis and bought up the stock of troubled companies in an effort to halt the collapse."
515,2022-06-25,2022-06-25,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"Dan Milmo,Alex Hern",www.theguardian.com,Changpeng Zhao: tech chief in the eye of the cryptocurrency storm,"The founder of Binance, the world’s largest digital currency exchange, is on a mission to talk to governments and regulators even as investors retreat",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/25/changpeng-zhao-tech-chief-in-the-eye-of-the-cryptocurrency-storm,"Changpeng Zhao does not like ambiguous words. Which is just as well: the crypto industry, in which he is a leading figure, is in turmoil and crying out for clarity.
The 45-year-old founder and chief executive of Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, meets the Observer in an upmarket London hotel after one of the most tumultuous weeks in the short history of digital money.
Binance was forced to suspend its bitcoin business on 13 June for a few hours. On the same day, a major crypto lender, Celsius, also paused withdrawals. Then a big crypto hedge fund admitted it was in trouble. Finally, last Saturday, in a symbolic moment, bitcoin fell below $20,000. The cornerstone of crypto has lost more than half its value this year, leaving both professional and amateur investors nursing steep losses.
Often referred to by the nickname CZ (see-zee), Zhao is dressed in the classic tech-tycoon mix of formal dark suit with a company T-shirt and trainers. He says he is travelling from country to country at the moment, meeting with “different government officials, regulators”.
Despite his softly spoken manner, he is on a mission to convince. The conversation gets hooked on semantics at times – perhaps a response to the level of scrutiny he and his business are under. Asked if he still considers the recent crypto market moves to be “normal”, as he described them this month, Zhao says: “Normal depends on how you look at it … everybody has a different definition of normal … fluctuations in price is normal.”
There is a similar focus on meaning when Zhao is asked about money laundering – “the word is very different in different countries” – although he says Binance can “for sure” do a “good enough job that the regulators are happy”.
Last June, the Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance to stop all regulated activities in Britain, saying it was “not capable of being effectively supervised”. Zhao has not given up, however, and says he is seeking a licence to operate.
Last week, Bloomberg ran an interview with him that raised the prospect of a deep regulatory winter for his business. He responded by tweeting to his 6.5 million followers: “I will stop doing interviews with news outlets that do clickbait titles.”
He clearly has a deep interest in media. Binance has announced plans for a $200m (£160m) investment in Forbes, the business publisher, as well as investing $500m in Elon Musk’s $44bn bid for Twitter.
Born in the coastal province of Jiangsu, north of Shanghai, Zhao followed his academic father to Canada when he was 12. After graduating from Montreal’s McGill University with a degree in computer science he worked on programming systems for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Bloomberg. Zhao then moved to Shanghai in 2005, where he founded a high-frequency trading platform.
It was there that he was drawn into a conversation about bitcoin during a poker game in 2013. Binance was founded four years later.

The impact of recent events on Zhao’s fortune has been precipitous, according to one source. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates that his wealth – based on a 90% stake in Binance and his control of its related US exchange – has fallen by more than $75bn since January to $20.6bn, as the wider market has more than halved over the same period to about $900bn.
Zhao laughs that off. “I actually have no idea how they come up with those numbers. You need to understand that net worth are just estimates,” he says. “When I look at my wallet, I don’t have that much. I don’t have anywhere close to any of those numbers.”
If you are wondering how Zhao could find $20bn in his wallet anyway, he is referring to his crypto wallet – the encrypted account on a blockchain where digital money is stored. Although all blockchain activity is technically public, most large investors try to keep their wallets pseudonymous, and Zhao’s has not been publicly identified.
Binance makes money by connecting buyers with sellers, for a fee. It provides an exchange for a range of currencies, from bitcoin to dogecoin and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The company also offers to store those assets in a crypto wallet, and there is a range of financial products, including derivatives. It has 120 million customers globally and processes $1tn worth of trades a month, with Italy and France among the countries it is allowed to operate in, although customers can access it through the unregulated, offshore binance.com platform.
Last year, Zhao told the AP news agency that he only held bitcoin and his firm’s own crypto-asset, BNB.
One issue puzzling regulators is the lack of clarity about Binance’s structure. The holding company is registered in the Cayman Islands but the company describes itself as having “decentralised” ownership, with its terms and conditions referring to an “ecosystem”. For instance, its US exchange is separate from the main binance.com platform, whose operating base is not disclosed.
We absolutely have sympathy for anyone who has lost money in trading in any market, including stock markets Changpeng Zhao
Some of the other questions over Binance are more serious. Reuters published a report in June that alleged it had served as a conduit for the laundering of at least $2.35bn in illicit funds from hacks, investment frauds and illegal drug sales.
Zhao says he disputes the claims “very heavily”, adding the public record afforded by blockchains should have enabled Binance to trace the transactions. “We ask for a list of transactions, not just a list of names. They provided zero.”
Reuters said: “We stand by our reporting on Binance, which has been consistent with the Trust Principles [its in-house guidelines] of accuracy and freedom from bias.”
The conversation moves on to those who have had savings wiped out by the crypto rout. “We absolutely have sympathy for anyone who has lost money in trading in any market, including stock markets,” says Zhao. He says financial literacy is key, and mentions his company’s own Binance Academy.
He concedes there could be more failures in the crypto market. But he is unambiguous that there will be survivors. “There may be other failures. But crypto will stay, bitcoin will stay, ethereum will stay, BNB will stay. That part is quite certain.”"

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.
Crypto markets have recovered a bit, following last week’s brutal crash that shaved off more than 30% of the value from leading coins Bitcoin and Ethereum, which dropped to levels not seen since 2020.
Bitcoin is up more than 10% over the last seven days, trading for $21,013 as of this writing, and Ethereum reclaimed even more territory, surging more than 19% to $1,189.
Polygon’s week was even better: It rose almost 59% to better than $.57, buoyed by six weeks of whale accumulation—according to on-chain data analytics from Santiment—and a partnership announced this week with on-chain carbon market KlimaDAO.
Cryptocurrencies that rose at least 40% over the seven days were Uniswap, up 45% to $5.33, and Shiba Inu, up 43% to $0.00001122. Meanwhile, Avalanche added nearly 33%, to $20.10, and Solana rose almost 33%, to $40.05.
In fact, every top 30 cryptocurrency managed to recover by double digit percentages by the weekend, except Cardano, which still added 4% to hit $0.4845, and TRON, which rose 8% to $0.06445.
Bitcoin Cash actually fell 5.4% over the week, to $113.7 as of this writing, while TRON’s stablecoin USDD has for two weeks now traded below its peg. It’s currently at $0.9768.
'Fragmentation'
It was a relatively quiet news week, which probably aided the crypto market’s upswing.
On Tuesday, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a global organization of 63 leading central banks, published its Annual Economic Report 2022. The report says crypto has two main flaws: the need for a “nominal anchor” and “fragmentation.”
A “nominal anchor” refers to stablecoins, which peg their value to fiat currencies, like the U.S. Dollar (with varying degrees of success). BIS says that the existence of stablecoins “indicates the pervasive need in the crypto sector to piggyback on the credibility provided by the unit of account issued by the central bank.”
The report argues that cryptocurrencies have yet to challenge the hegemony of central banks in providing a unit of account for the economy: “The fact that stablecoins must import the credibility of central bank money is highly revealing of crypto’s structural shortcomings. That stablecoins are often less stable than their issuers claim shows that they are at best an imperfect substitute for sound sovereign currency.”
The report also points to the “fragmentation” of the sector, the abundance of various cryptocurrencies competing for supremacy, as “perhaps crypto’s greatest flaw as the basis for a monetary system.”
The BIS report expounds on the utility of blockchain technology for central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs—essentially state-issued stablecoins pegged to domestic currencies. It also points to smart contract technology—self-executing financial contracts on blockchains—as one of a number of advantages that will “enable transactions between financial intermediaries that go beyond the traditional medium of central bank reserves.”
The U.S. and EU central bank head honchos, Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde, separately argued for regulation of cryptocurrencies this week, citing the speed at which the blockchain is growing, alongside possible economic risks, though both also said crypto doesn’t pose any immediate threats.
On Wednesday, U.S. congressman Jim Himes (D-CT) released a proposal outlining how the country could implement a CBDC, claiming it could help safeguard the dollar’s role as the world’s leading reserve currency.
“The longer the United States government waits to embrace this innovation, the further we fall behind both foreign governments and the private sector,” Himes said in a statement. “It is time for Congress to consider and move forward with legislation that would authorize a U.S. CBDC.”
The following day, Powell told the House Committee on Financial Services that Congress eventually will receive guidance from the Fed on how it could implement a CBDC.
“We’re doing a great deal of work,” he said, adding that once the Fed has worked out a policy recommendation, it will be up to Congress to draft the appropriate legislation.
Finally, data by Arcane Research revealed that publicly traded Bitcoin miners, like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain, sold more Bitcoin than they mined last month—a huge change from the first four months of the year, when miners sold 30% of their earnings.
Jaran Mellerud, an Arcane Research Bitcoin mining analyst, wrote in the report: “If they are forced to liquidate a considerable share of these holdings, it could contribute to pushing the Bitcoin price further down.”"

Crypto exchange Binance has launched a new platform for VIP and institutional investors. The VIP program allows Binance users to “get rewarded with more discounts and VIP privileges” as their trading volume climbs up VIP tiers.
‘Binance Institutional’ Launched
Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced Thursday the launch of “Binance Institutional,” a new platform for VIP and institutional cryptocurrency investors. It is one of Binance’s efforts “to upgrade its institutional offerings and services,” the exchange said.
Binance Institutional’s services are tailored for all types of institutions, its website describes. They include asset managers, brokers, hedge funds, family offices, proprietary trading firms, liquidity providers, high net worth individuals, and mining companies.
The new platform offers a number of services, including direct access to OTC liquidity, asset management, custody, and brokerage.
Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) commented:
Brokerage services are well positioned to help our industry bridge some of the gaps between the crypto and traditional financial markets and drive continued digital asset growth.
The VIP program allows users to “get rewarded with more discounts and VIP privileges” as their trading volume climbs up VIP tiers, Binance explained. VIP privileges include fee discounts and higher 24-hour withdrawal limits.
The exchange offers nine VIP tiers. A VIP must have a 30-day trade volume of at least 1 million BUSD and a balance of at least 25 BNB. A level nine VIP has a 30-day trade volume of at least 5 billion BUSD and a BNB balance of at least 5,500.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly investigating Binance’s BNB token, alleging that it could be an unregistered security.

This price range is a decisive support region for the cryptocurrency.
Technical Analysis
By Shayan
The Daily Chart
Bitcoin’s bearish momentum has been weakened after an impulsive crash leading to a short-term consolidation. However, another sudden move to the downside might occur if the negative sentiment intensifies, driven by external forces again, pushing the market below the current support level and closer to $15K.
On the other hand, the yellow trendline has served as a mid-term resistance for the price. The trendline has recently rejected BTC, initiating the leg down to the $17K level. Nevertheless, the channel’s mid-trendline, the 50-day moving average, and the mentioned level are the main obstacles on Bitcoin’s path to higher price channels.
The 4-Hour Chart
On the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price has been forming a bearish descending channel. The primary support level at $20K and the channel’s lower boundary have ended the recent bearish impulsive move.
Currently, the price has reached the channel’s mid-trendline, which is the main barrier for Bitcoin in the 4-hour timeframe, and a descending trendline(yellow line). In the case of a reversal from this price region, the cryptocurrency needs to break the middle barrier and the yellow trendline to retest the channel’s upper boundary. Otherwise, the price will likely get rejected again, heading to retest the $17K for the second time.
Onchain Analysis
By Shayan
When market participants suffer significant losses, suggesting a “Capitulation” event, markets usually enter a bottom discovery structure phase. Given that long-term holders own most of the supply, there is a lot of emphasis on their capitulation in the Bitcoin market. A long-term holders’ capitulation phase is needed for a multi-year bottom to form.
This chart consists of the 30-day exponential moving average of the Long-Term Holder SOPR and Bitcoin’s price. It is apparent that during prior bear markets, a lengthy period of long-term holders’ capitulation occurred since they significantly realized losses. The fact that the metric has fallen below 1 indicates selling pressure from long-term investors. This has frequently triggered the last stage of the bear market. Nevertheless, It should be noted that this phase might take several frustrating months of volatility accompanied by numerous massive shakeouts."

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Close To Zero, But Still Negative
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the selling pressure from US investors seems to have reduced in recent days.
The “Coinbase Premium Gap” is an indicator that measures the difference in the Bitcoin prices listed on crypto exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).
The quant notes that US investors are known to use the Coinbase platform, especially high-net entities and institutions.
When the value of this metric is positive, it means the price on Coinbase is higher at the moment. Such a trend suggests there has been buying from US investors recently.

On the other hand, a negative premium gap implies there has been some selling on the crypto exchange as the price is lesser than on Binance.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase premium gap over the year 2022 so far:

As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase premium gap has been negative in the last couple of months.
During the LUNA crash, it reached a highly red value of $131, which means there was some heavy selling from US investors then.
During the consolidation period that followed, as well as during the latest crash, the value of the indicator moved sideways around a negative $20.

Over the last few days, however, the trend seems to have changed and the premium gap is now observing some upwards movement.
While the indicator still has a negative value, it’s quite close to zero now as the gap between Coinbase and Binance stands at just -$5.
This shows that the selling pressure from US investors has been dying down recently, a sign that could prove to be bullish for the price of Bitcoin.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $21.2k, up 11% in the last seven days. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 28% in value.

As the headwinds impacting global financial markets beat down all traces of bullish sentiment, many crypto investors are predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) price could drop to as low as $10,000 before a market bottom is found.

While many traders scoffed at the idea of BTC falling below its 2017 all-time high, the recent dip to $17,600 suggests that this bear market could be different from the last one.
Here’s what several analysts are saying about the possibility of Bitcoin falling to $10,000 in the next few weeks.
Historic pullbacks point to a low at $10,350
Insight into how BTC may perform in the short-term can be gleaned by looking at its performance during the bear market cycles of 2013 and 2017. In 2013, the maximum drawdown for Bitcoin was 85%, which took place over a period of 407 days. The maximum drawdown in 2017 was 84% and this period lasted for 364 days.

According to a recent report by Arcane Research, the current drawdown has been going on for 229 days and has thus far seen a maximum drawdown of 73%.
Arcane Research said,
“If Bitcoin follows the blueprint of these cycles, a bottom should occur sometime in late Q4 2022, at a price as low as $10,350.”
While there is always a chance that an 85% pullback is a possibility, Arcane Research also noted that “Bitcoin is now far more intertwined in the broad financial markets, with the Fed, U.S. elections, crypto regulations and stock market impacting its performance.”
Further evidence that supports the possibility of a drop to the $10,000 range was touched upon by cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital, who posted the following chart noting that “From a high timeframe market structure perspective, the next place we have to be looking at is $10K–$12K.”

Based on the chart above, the high timeframe market structure support is likely to exist between $9,500 and $13,500.
Delphi Digital said,
“Coincidentally, this area lines up with the implied low if BTC experiences an 85% drawdown from peak to trough.”
Would $10,000 be a good spot to go long?
Not every analyst expects a drop to $10,000. Take for example, Will Clemente of Blockware Solutions. According to Clemente, Bitcoin's current range reflects a good spot for accumulation.

Additional data from Glassnode shows that Bitcoin’s 200-week moving average, balance price and delta price in its bear market floor model align with the 0.6 Mayer Multiple metric analyzed by Clemente.

Glassnode said,
“Only 13 out of 4,360 trading days (0.2%) have ever seen similar circumstances, occurring in just two prior events, Jan 2015 and March 2020. These points are marked in green on the chart.”
Based on the Delta price metric, which still remains untouched, the potential low for BTC is $15,750.

John Bollinger, the creator of the popular Bollinger Bands trading indicator also suggested that Bitcoin price may have bottomed.
According to Bollinger:
“Picture perfect double (M-type) top in BTCUSD on the monthly chart complete with confirmation by BandWidth and %b leads to a tag of the lower Bollinger Band. No sign of one yet, but this would be a logical place to put in a bottom.”

523,2022-06-28,2022-06-28,Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency,"About The Author,Bilal Jafar",www.financemagnates.com,Bitcoin Investment Products See Historic Outflows,"Last week, Bitcoin investment products witnessed record-breaking outflows.",https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-investment-products-see-historic-outflows/,"Last week, Bitcoin investment products witnessed record-breaking outflows after the world’s largest crypto asset briefly touched a low of $17,700, which is the lowest level since November 2020. Overall, weekly outflows from crypto investment products stood at $423 million.
BTC products accounted for outflows worth $453 million last week. Surprisingly, Ethereum investment products witnessed inflows worth almost $11 million. Last week, short-Bitcoin investment products saw inflows of approximately $15 million.
Despite Bitcoin’s price recovery from the recent lows, the crypto asset is trading down by almost 70% from its all-time highs in November 2021. Similar to retail traders, institutional investors are also pulling money out of the crypto market.
“The outflows were solely focused on Bitcoin, which saw net outflows for the week totaling US$453m, erasing almost all inflows year-to-date and leaving total Bitcoin AuM at US$24.5bn, the lowest point since the beginning of 2021. Short-Bitcoin saw inflows totaling US$15m due to the launch of the first US-based short investment product last week, while older short-investment products saw outflows. Ethereum saw inflows totaling US$11m, the first following 11 consecutive weeks of outflows,” CoinShares highlighted in its weekly digital asset fund flows report.
Regional Outflows
According to the details shared by CoinShares, Canadian exchanges and crypto services providers saw most of the outflows last week. On the other hand, European providers witnessed decent inflows during the mentioned period.
“Regionally, the outflows were almost solely from Canadian exchanges and one specific provider. The outflows occurred on 17th June but were reflected in last week’s figures due to trade reporting lags, and were likely responsible for Bitcoin’s decline to US$17,760 that weekend. Stripping out the US$493m outflows reveals that other providers saw aggregate inflows totaling US$70m, highlighting highly polarised sentiment amongst digital asset investors,” the report added.
The market cap of cryptocurrencies dropped by almost $2 trillion in the last seven months."

The flagship cryptocurrency cannot seem to keep its head above water as massive investor selloffs keep the price from rebounding. Bitcoin even declined to an 18-month low, falling below $18,000 earlier this month.
However, one sign that could offer some reassurance is the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges. According to Glassnode data, Bitcoin balances held by exchanges fell to a 3-year low of 2,384,477 BTC yesterday.
The amount of exchange-held Bitcoin is an indicator of the overall market sentiment. Generally, the supply of bitcoin on exchanges jumps when BTC is transferred to exchanges to be sold. Recent figures back this notion, with the largest inflow of Bitcoin since 2018 being recorded on June 14, 2022. Five days later, BTC hit a low of $17,744.
On the other hand, the last time Bitcoin exchange reserves hit an all-time low (3 years ago), the price of Bitcoin took off. It was a similar story in September 2021: Bitcoin held on exchanges began to plummet, and prices began to rally, eventually leading to an all-time high for the legacy coin. This inverse relation between exchange-held Bitcoin and prices can be seen in the chart below:
The Glassnode post also reveals that the previous 3-year low of 2,384,519 BTC was observed as recently as two days ago. This shows that exchange-held Bitcoin is on a gradual decrease.
Amid these trying times, another interesting and encouraging metric has come to light. Investors are looking to buy the dip and add to their BTC stockpile while prices are low. Glassnode reported that the number of ‘non-zero wallets’ touched an all-time high (ATH) of 42 million. Moreover, the number of Bitcoin wallets holding one or more BTC also touched an ATH of 870,762.
However, it’s not all good news. According to Coinshares data, Bitcoin-specific funds have witnessed a $453 million outflow in the last week. An outflow is when investors sell their crypto-based funds and this is often a bearish sign.
Also Read:
This latest outflow has more than neutralised any inflows during the previous six months. And according to the report, Toronto-based Purpose Investments’ crypto products contributed to the lion’s share of the losses, suffering a whopping $490.7 million outflow in the last week. This could be due to the recent 0.50 percent rate hike by the Bank of Canada.
All-in-all, the total Bitcoin assets under management (AuM) currently stand at $24.5 billion — the lowest in 18 months. Bitcoin is currently trading at $20,968 — shedding 2.4 percent over the last 24 hours and 70 percent since the ATH of $69,000 from November 2021. Bitcoin’s market capitalisation is $396.65 billion at the time of writing."

Now Grayscale is suing.
In its ruling, the SEC said the Grayscale spot ETF application did not do enough to protect investors from ""fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.""
After the SEC made its announcement, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein quickly took to Twitter to announce the legal action.
We’ve filed a lawsuit against the SEC. $GBTC — Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) June 30, 2022
According to Grayscale, the company is filing a “petition for review” with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to challenge the decision to deny the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF.
""We are deeply disappointed by and vehemently disagree with the SEC's decision to continue to deny spot Bitcoin ETFs from coming to the U.S. market,"" said Sonnenshein in a press release.
Sonnenshein went on to say that Grayscale would continue to leverage all of its resources to advocate for its investors and the ""equitable regulatory treatment of Bitcoin investment vehicles.”
Earlier this month, in preparation for the SEC decision, Grayscale announced it had hired legal counsel, including Donald B. Verrilli, Jr., former Solicitor General of the United States, and law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.
As we enter the final month before a response is due on our application to convert $GBTC to an ETF, we have retained Donald B. Verrilli, Jr., former Solicitor General of the United States, as additional legal counsel. A short 🧵 on why: — Grayscale (@Grayscale) June 7, 2022
""The SEC is failing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles, and is therefore acting arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and Securities Exchange Act of 1934,"" Verrilli said in Grayscale's press release responding to the SEC rejection.
Grayscale, founded in 2013, is a subsidiary of Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group. The company provides market information, investment products, and exposure to digital assets. Since its launch, Grayscale has filed several applications for Bitcoin ETFs.
In a notice to the SEC last October, Grayscale wrote about its approval journey: ""Grayscale first submitted an application for a Bitcoin ETF in 2016 and spent the better part of 2017 in conversations with the SEC. Ultimately, we withdrew our application because we believed the regulatory environment for digital assets had not advanced to the point where such a product could successfully be brought to market.""
It appears the SEC believes the crypto environment still isn't ready.
What is an ETF and why does Grayscale want one?
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) bundles securities like stocks or commodities, allowing investors to buy shares on the public market without directly owning the assets—in this case, Bitcoin. Last October, the SEC finally allowed a Bitcoin futures ETF, which offers derivative contracts that speculate on the future price of Bitcoin. It has still not allowed a Bitcoin spot ETF, which would be tied to Bitcoin's current price.
According to Grayscale, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust currently has $12.9 billion under management. Shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have traded at significantly less than the net value of the Bitcoin held by Grayscale since February 2021.
By changing the trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale hopes to correct Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s ""discount"" and allow the investment firm to charge lower fees, making it easier to move money in and out of the fund.
In April, Grayscale launched a broad marketing campaign asking the public to advocate for a Bitcoin ETF to SEC. The campaign ran in several media outlets, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post.
According to the release from Grayscale, the comment campaign brought in 11,400 total submissions to the SEC. Today's ruling comes a week before the deadline for comments and is the latest setback for Grayscale, which has had every ETF application rejected by the SEC since the firm first began applying in early 2017."
